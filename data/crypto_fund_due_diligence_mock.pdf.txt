Crypto Capital Partners is a regulated digital asset investment firm headquartered in Switzerland,
operating as a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschr?nkter Haftung). It is fully compliant with Swiss
FINMA regulations and EU AMLD5 directives. The firm has maintained a stable legal structure since
its inception in 2018 and holds all necessary licenses to operate across multiple jurisdictions,
including the European Union, Singapore, and the United States.
The fund complies with securities laws such as MiFID II, the U.S. Securities Act, and local Know
Your Customer (KYC) regulations. It performs regular transaction monitoring and sanctions
screening using Chainalysis and Elliptic tools. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies are reviewed
annually and conducted by an independent compliance team.
Crypto Capital Partners owns several IP assets, including proprietary portfolio management
algorithms and a secured digital asset custody system. All IPs are registered and validated under
Swiss and EU intellectual property laws. There are currently no ongoing IP infringement cases or
legal disputes.
Digital assets are stored using a combination of cold wallets and multi-signature wallets managed
via Fireblocks. Ownership is verified on-chain using Merkle proof attestations. All custody solutions
are audited by third-party security firms.
Trading follows strict compliance protocols and uses automated surveillance systems to detect
market manipulation. The company uses smart contract auditing tools such as CertiK and Trail of
Bits, and mandates two-factor authentication and end-to-end encryption across all internal systems.
The source code for core infrastructure is partially open-source under an MIT license and availableon GitHub. Known inefficiencies, such as fee slippage during high volatility, are currently being
addressed with off-chain execution layers.
User feedback suggests the fund's reporting interface is intuitive, though onboarding could be
improved. Regular cost audits and financial statements are published quarterly and verified by PwC.
Revenue is diversified across staking, market-making, and venture investments. The firm raised
$50M in Series A from major institutional investors like a16z and Pantera Capital, with plans for a
Series B next year.
Environmental sustainability is a priority. The fund avoids energy-intensive Proof-of-Work assets and
supports green initiatives via the Crypto Climate Accord. The board of directors consists of
experienced professionals from finance, law, and technology sectors. Governance decisions are
voted on quarterly and publicly documented.
The technology stack includes Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche integrations with Chainlink and
The Graph. Regular penetration tests are conducted by Kudelski Security. Smart contract
vulnerabilities are resolved in coordination with ethical hackers through a bug bounty program.
Training, operational risk management, tax compliance, and insurance coverage are all updated
annually and disclosed in the fund?s due diligence pack available to accredited investors.
Crypto Capital Partners maintains active partnerships with Binance Custody, Chainalysis, and
Coinbase Institutional, and actively contributes to open-source initiatives and regulatory dialogues in
the EU and Asia-Pacific.

and ESG progress reports aligned with the UN PRI.
