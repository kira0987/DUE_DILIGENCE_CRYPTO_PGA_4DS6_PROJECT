The beginning of our collaboration was marked by our first white paper, “Advancing the Digital Asset Era, Together.” Building on this, we have worked together to develop the “Digital Asset Securities Control Principles” (DASCP), which are presented in this white paper. The principles serve as a set of guidelines underpinning our collective resolve to uphold the highest standards of integrity, security, and interoperability. This framework is crucial for creating an inclusive, resilient financial ecosystem that is adaptable to technological advancements and responsive to diverse market needs. We would like to thank BCG for its valuable support in enriching and testing this framework. The DASCP marks the starting point of further industry- wide engagement to enable standardization, drive adoption, and unlock value. To achieve these goals, we intend to put these principles into action. By leveraging them in our digital asset activities, we will effectively demonstrate to clients, regulators, and the broader industry that digital asset securities can be just as safe and secure as traditional assets. We will also advise and support market participants as they leverage the principles in their own business activities. Ultimately, we believe that industry collaboration is not only the most expedient way – but also the most effective way – to build a robust global digital assets ecosystem. We invite you to join us in this exciting journey that has the potential to redefine global finance, ensuring that this digital transformation benefits the ecosystem and contributes to sustainable economic growth. We look forward to your support and engagement as we collectively expand upon these principles, setting new standards for financial markets worldwide.

Programmability, self-executing automation, and instantaneous reconciliation are key features that have the potential to transform the industry. Central to this transformation is DLT, which enables nearly immediate transaction settlement and creates immutable transaction records. Asset tokenization leverages DLT to create reusable processes that can be quickly adapted to develop new DAS and manage their life cycles, enhancing operational scalability. With these advantages, financial institutions are increasingly investing in DAS to unlock these transformative benefits. Overall, propelled by smart contracts and automated processes in different areas, annual global infrastructure operational cost savings of ~$15-20 billion have been estimated.1 Furthermore, due to shortened settlement cycles, DLT impacts on collateral management could release ~$100+ billion annually in freed financial resources.2 By 2030, the tokenization of global illiquid assets is projected to be a $16 trillion business opportunity,3 significantly increasing asset liquidity and expanding market participation.

In building upon the foundation laid by our previous collaborative publication, Advancing the Digital Asset Era, Together,5 this white paper delineates our journey toward adopting Digital Assets. It recognizes the collaborative efforts needed from FMIs, regulatory bodies, and the broader financial community, advocating for a united approach to address challenges, drive innovation, and seize the opportunities DAS offer.

The DASCP was developed in multiple layers along foundational principles, risks, and controls.",

In translating these principles into practice, the figure on page 17 maps the controls applied at each transactional junction, demonstrating how specific risks are addressed through tailored controls. The central role of smart contracts is evident throughout the process, offering a robust means to automate intricate transaction sequences, ensure regulatory adherence, and protect the integrity of the loan’s data and functions.

C19-S Smart Contract Entitlements: Restrict access to smart contract data and functions based on standard roles using fine-grain entitlements. A smart contract, combined with a specific token standard, grants the lending decision to the lending pool, ensuring that only the lending pool can issue and approve a loan. This ensures immutability of roles, entitlement, and processes, thus eliminating the risk of unauthorized use or access to the loan’s data and functions. Operational Scalability R32 Inability to Scale: DLT networks may not efficiently manage or scale to accommodate surging transaction volumes, impacting critical functions such as post-trade capture and overall transaction throughput (including suitable customer support), potentially degrading system performance and reliability. C24-S Functions / Behaviors: Conform to a common set of functions, behaviors, and service level agreements that support various security life cycle operations such as issuance and settlement. Smart contracts enable automation and atomic settlement of transactions, which provides scalability to perform large volumes of standardized yet complex operations in seconds.
