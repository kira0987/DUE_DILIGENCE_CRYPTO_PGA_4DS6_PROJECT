BUILDING THE DIGITAL ASSET SECURITIES ECOSYSTEM 19 Contents Principle Risk Control Smart Contract Control Activities Resilience and Security R23 Asset Mismanagement: Digital assets are at risk of being lost, stolen, or erroneously transferred due to breaches in operational controls, system vulnerabilities, or inadequate asset management protocols. C19-S Smart Contract Entitlements: Restrict access to smart contract data and functions based on standard roles using fine-grain entitlements. A smart contract, combined with a specific token standard, grants the lending decision to the lending pool, ensuring that only the lending pool can issue and approve a loan. This ensures immutability of roles, entitlement, and processes, thus eliminating the risk of unauthorized use or access to the loan’s data and functions. Operational Scalability R32 Inability to Scale: DLT networks may not efficiently manage or scale to accommodate surging transaction volumes, impacting critical functions such as post-trade capture and overall transaction throughput (including suitable customer support), potentially degrading system performance and reliability. C24-S Functions / Behaviors: Conform to a common set of functions, behaviors, and service level agreements that support various security life cycle operations such as issuance and settlement. Smart contracts enable automation and atomic settlement of transactions, which provides scalability to perform large volumes of standardized yet complex operations in seconds. For example, for the lending transaction, the smart contract performed six functions in one step (deposit, issuance, approval, deposit, hair-cutting, and pledging).

The principles serve as a set of guidelines underpinning our collective resolve to uphold the highest standards of integrity, security, and interoperability. This framework is crucial for creating an inclusive, resilient financial ecosystem that is adaptable to technological advancements and responsive to diverse market needs. We would like to thank BCG for its valuable support in enriching and testing this framework. The DASCP marks the starting point of further industry- wide engagement to enable standardization, drive adoption, and unlock value. To achieve these goals, we intend to put these principles into action. By leveraging them in our digital asset activities, we will effectively demonstrate to clients, regulators, and the broader industry that digital asset securities can be just as safe and secure as traditional assets. We will also advise and support market participants as they leverage the principles in their own business activities. Ultimately, we believe that industry collaboration is not only the most expedient way – but also the most effective way – to build a robust global digital assets ecosystem. We invite you to join us in this exciting journey that has the potential to redefine global finance, ensuring that this digital transformation benefits the ecosystem and contributes to sustainable economic growth.

C19-S Smart Contract Entitlements: Restrict access to smart contract data and functions based on standard roles using fine-grain entitlements. A smart contract, combined with a specific token standard, grants the lending decision to the lending pool, ensuring that only the lending pool can issue and approve a loan. This ensures immutability of roles, entitlement, and processes, thus eliminating the risk of unauthorized use or access to the loan’s data and functions. Operational Scalability R32 Inability to Scale: DLT networks may not efficiently manage or scale to accommodate surging transaction volumes, impacting critical functions such as post-trade capture and overall transaction throughput (including suitable customer support), potentially degrading system performance and reliability. C24-S Functions / Behaviors: Conform to a common set of functions, behaviors, and service level agreements that support various security life cycle operations such as issuance and settlement. Smart contracts enable automation and atomic settlement of transactions, which provides scalability to perform large volumes of standardized yet complex operations in seconds. For example, for the lending transaction, the smart contract performed six functions in one step (deposit, issuance, approval, deposit, hair-cutting, and pledging).

Thus, they function more as guidelines rather than rigid controls and are crafted to address multiple risks, offering flexibility to adjust to different technologies and products. These controls are also dynamic, allowing for iterative updates to keep pace with the changing risk landscape and emerging technological advancements. The following controls have been derived and mapped to the risks they are mitigating. Each control mitigates at least one risk, with many controls addressing multiple risks.

Programmability, self-executing automation, and instantaneous reconciliation are key features that have the potential to transform the industry. Central to this transformation is DLT, which enables nearly immediate transaction settlement and creates immutable transaction records. Asset tokenization leverages DLT to create reusable processes that can be quickly adapted to develop new DAS and manage their life cycles, enhancing operational scalability. With these advantages, financial institutions are increasingly investing in DAS to unlock these transformative benefits. Overall, propelled by smart contracts and automated processes in different areas, annual global infrastructure operational cost savings of ~$15-20 billion have been estimated.1 Furthermore, due to shortened settlement cycles, DLT impacts on collateral management could release ~$100+ billion annually in freed financial resources.2 By 2030, the tokenization of global illiquid assets is projected to be a $16 trillion business opportunity,3 significantly increasing asset liquidity and expanding market participation. This shift not only promises enhanced efficiency and transparency but also democratizes access to investment opportunities, reshaping the financial landscape for a more inclusive future."

Programmability, self-executing automation, and instantaneous reconciliation are key features that have the potential to transform the industry. Central to this transformation is DLT, which enables nearly immediate transaction settlement and creates immutable transaction records. Asset tokenization leverages DLT to create reusable processes that can be quickly adapted to develop new DAS and manage their life cycles, enhancing operational scalability. With these advantages, financial institutions are increasingly investing in DAS to unlock these transformative benefits. Overall, propelled by smart contracts and automated processes in different areas, annual global infrastructure operational cost savings of ~$15-20 billion have been estimated.1 Furthermore, due to shortened settlement cycles, DLT impacts on collateral management could release ~$100+ billion annually in freed financial resources.2 By 2030, the tokenization of global illiquid assets is projected to be a $16 trillion business opportunity,3 significantly increasing asset liquidity and expanding market participation. This shift not only promises enhanced efficiency and transparency but also democratizes access to investment opportunities, reshaping the financial landscape for a more inclusive future."

C19-S Smart Contract Entitlements: Restrict access to smart contract data and functions based on standard roles using fine-grain entitlements. A smart contract, combined with a specific token standard, grants the lending decision to the lending pool, ensuring that only the lending pool can issue and approve a loan. This ensures immutability of roles, entitlement, and processes, thus eliminating the risk of unauthorized use or access to the loan’s data and functions.

Programmability, self-executing automation, and instantaneous reconciliation are key features that have the potential to transform the industry. Central to this transformation is DLT, which enables nearly immediate transaction settlement and creates immutable transaction records. Asset tokenization leverages DLT to create reusable processes that can be quickly adapted to develop new DAS and manage their life cycles, enhancing operational scalability. With these advantages, financial institutions are increasingly investing in DAS to unlock these transformative benefits. Overall, propelled by smart contracts and automated processes in different areas, annual global infrastructure operational cost savings of ~$15-20 billion have been estimated.1 Furthermore, due to shortened settlement cycles, DLT impacts on collateral management could release ~$100+ billion annually in freed financial resources.2 By 2030, the tokenization of global illiquid assets is projected to be a $16 trillion business opportunity,3 significantly increasing asset liquidity and expanding market participation. This shift not only promises enhanced efficiency and transparency but also democratizes access to investment opportunities, reshaping the financial landscape for a more inclusive future."

C19-S Smart Contract Entitlements: Restrict access to smart contract data and functions based on standard roles using fine-grain entitlements. A smart contract, combined with a specific token standard, grants the lending decision to the lending pool, ensuring that only the lending pool can issue and approve a loan. This ensures immutability of roles, entitlement, and processes, thus eliminating the risk of unauthorized use or access to the loan’s data and functions. Operational Scalability R32 Inability to Scale: DLT networks may not efficiently manage or scale to accommodate surging transaction volumes, impacting critical functions such as post-trade capture and overall transaction throughput (including suitable customer support), potentially degrading system performance and reliability. C24-S Functions / Behaviors: Conform to a common set of functions, behaviors, and service level agreements that support various security life cycle operations such as issuance and settlement. Smart contracts enable automation and atomic settlement of transactions, which provides scalability to perform large volumes of standardized yet complex operations in seconds. For example, for the lending transaction, the smart contract performed six functions in one step (deposit, issuance, approval, deposit, hair-cutting, and pledging).

Programmability, self-executing automation, and instantaneous reconciliation are key features that have the potential to transform the industry. Central to this transformation is DLT, which enables nearly immediate transaction settlement and creates immutable transaction records. Asset tokenization leverages DLT to create reusable processes that can be quickly adapted to develop new DAS and manage their life cycles, enhancing operational scalability. With these advantages, financial institutions are increasingly investing in DAS to unlock these transformative benefits. Overall, propelled by smart contracts and automated processes in different areas, annual global infrastructure operational cost savings of ~$15-20 billion have been estimated.1 Furthermore, due to shortened settlement cycles, DLT impacts on collateral management could release ~$100+ billion annually in freed financial resources.2 By 2030, the tokenization of global illiquid assets is projected to be a $16 trillion business opportunity,3 significantly increasing asset liquidity and expanding market participation. This shift not only promises enhanced efficiency and transparency but also democratizes access to investment opportunities, reshaping the financial landscape for a more inclusive future."

Programmability, self-executing automation, and instantaneous reconciliation are key features that have the potential to transform the industry. Central to this transformation is DLT, which enables nearly immediate transaction settlement and creates immutable transaction records. Asset tokenization leverages DLT to create reusable processes that can be quickly adapted to develop new DAS and manage their life cycles, enhancing operational scalability. With these advantages, financial institutions are increasingly investing in DAS to unlock these transformative benefits. Overall, propelled by smart contracts and automated processes in different areas, annual global infrastructure operational cost savings of ~$15-20 billion have been estimated.1 Furthermore, due to shortened settlement cycles, DLT impacts on collateral management could release ~$100+ billion annually in freed financial resources.2 By 2030, the tokenization of global illiquid assets is projected to be a $16 trillion business opportunity,3 significantly increasing asset liquidity and expanding market participation. This shift not only promises enhanced efficiency and transparency but also democratizes access to investment opportunities, reshaping the financial landscape for a more inclusive future."

According to ISSA’s recent survey, only 37% of the industry is live with DLT.4 The full benefits of DAS cannot be realized without more concerted and integrated efforts toward collaboration. In this context, FMIs have a crucial role to play. Historically the linchpins of the financial system, facilitating clearing, settlement, and recordkeeping, FMIs are now supporting the integration of DAS into the conventional financial fabric. In building upon the foundation laid by our previous collaborative publication, Advancing the Digital Asset Era, Together,5 this white paper delineates our journey toward adopting Digital Assets. It recognizes the collaborative efforts needed from FMIs, regulatory bodies, and the broader financial community, advocating for a united approach to address challenges, drive innovation, and seize the opportunities DAS offer. As highlighted by Valérie Urbain, CEO of Euroclear, FMIs are actively working “toward the co-creation of tomorrow’s financial system – one that’s open, inclusive, efficient, and resilient.”6 4DLT in the Real World Survey 2024 – Key Findings, International Securities Services Association, 2024 5DTCC, Clearstream, Euroclear, “Advancing the Digital Asset Era, Together”, Sept 2023 6Valérie Urbain, “Safety by design: Lessons in mainstreaming digital assets with resilience,” World Economic Forum, Apr 19, 2024 7Dr. Stephanie Eckerman, “Are digital infrastructures finally ready to scale?” Sibos 2023, Sept 2023 A Vision for Collaborative Advancement With this white paper, we are introducing the DASCP, which describes a DAS framework consisting of foundational principles for a secure and efficient ecosystem, risks arising from the implementation"

        "content": "in Global Capital Markets, 2023 DAS introduce new capabilities in financial services, re-envisioning existing processes and creating trust in real time. Programmability, self-executing automation, and instantaneous reconciliation are key features that have the potential to transform the industry. Central to this transformation is DLT, which enables nearly immediate transaction settlement and creates immutable transaction records. Asset tokenization leverages DLT to create reusable processes that can be quickly adapted to develop new DAS and manage their life cycles, enhancing operational scalability. With these advantages, financial institutions are increasingly investing in DAS to unlock these transformative benefits. Overall, propelled by smart contracts and automated processes in different areas, annual global infrastructure operational cost savings of ~$15-20 billion have been estimated.1 Furthermore, due to shortened settlement cycles, DLT impacts on collateral management could release ~$100+ billion annually in freed financial resources.2 By 2030, the tokenization of global illiquid assets is projected to be a $16 trillion business opportunity,3 significantly increasing asset liquidity and expanding market participation. This shift not only promises enhanced efficiency and transparency but also democratizes access to investment opportunities, reshaping the financial landscape for a more inclusive future."

Programmability, self-executing automation, and instantaneous reconciliation are key features that have the potential to transform the industry. Central to this transformation is DLT, which enables nearly immediate transaction settlement and creates immutable transaction records. Asset tokenization leverages DLT to create reusable processes that can be quickly adapted to develop new DAS and manage their life cycles, enhancing operational scalability. With these advantages, financial institutions are increasingly investing in DAS to unlock these transformative benefits. Overall, propelled by smart contracts and automated processes in different areas, annual global infrastructure operational cost savings of ~$15-20 billion have been estimated.1 Furthermore, due to shortened settlement cycles, DLT impacts on collateral management could release ~$100+ billion annually in freed financial resources.2 By 2030, the tokenization of global illiquid assets is projected to be a $16 trillion business opportunity,3 significantly increasing asset liquidity and expanding market participation. This shift not only promises enhanced efficiency and transparency but also democratizes access to investment opportunities, reshaping the financial landscape for a more inclusive future."
