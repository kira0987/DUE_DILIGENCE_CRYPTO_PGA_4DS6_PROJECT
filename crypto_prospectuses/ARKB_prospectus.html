<P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (the &#147;Trust&#148;) is an exchange-traded fund that issues common shares of beneficial interest (the
&#147;Shares&#148;) that trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the &#147;Exchange&#148;). The Trust&#146;s investment objective is to seek to track the performance of bitcoin, as measured by the performance of the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate - New
York Variant (the &#147;Index&#148;), adjusted for the Trust&#146;s expenses and other liabilities. CF Benchmarks Ltd. is the administrator for the Index (the &#147;Index Provider&#148;). The Index is designed to reflect the performance of bitcoin
in U.S. dollars. In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust will hold bitcoin and will value its Shares daily based on the Index. 21Shares US LLC (the &#147;Sponsor&#148;) is the sponsor of the Trust, Delaware Trust Company (the
&#147;Trustee&#148;) is the trustee of the Trust, and Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (&#147;Coinbase Custody&#148;) (the &#147;Bitcoin Custodian&#148;) is the bitcoin custodian for the Trust and will hold all of the Trust&#146;s bitcoin on the
Trust&#146;s behalf. ARK Investment Management LLC (the &#147;Sub-Adviser&#148;) is the sub-adviser of the Trust and provides assistance in the marketing of the Shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust is an exchange-traded fund. Barring a liquidation or extraordinary circumstances, the Trust does not intend on purchasing or selling
bitcoin other than in connection with the creation and redemption of Shares. The Sponsor may also sell bitcoin to pay certain expenses, which may be facilitated by the Prime Broker (as defined below) or any other prime brokers with whom the Trust
contracts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When the Trust sells or redeems its Shares, bitcoin will be transferred into or out of the Trust, as applicable, in exchange for
blocks of 5,000 Shares (a &#147;Basket&#148;) that are based on the quantity of bitcoin attributable to each Share of the Trust (net of accrued but unpaid Sponsor Fees (defined below) and any accrued but unpaid extraordinary expenses or
liabilities). Financial firms that are authorized to purchase Shares from or redeem Shares to the Trust (known as &#147;Authorized Participants&#148;) will purchase Shares by depositing cash in the Trust&#146;s account with the Cash Custodian. This
will cause the Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust, to automatically instruct a designated third party, who is not an Authorized Participant but who may be an affiliate of an Authorized Participant and with whom the Sponsor has entered into an agreement
on behalf of the Trust (each such third party, or the Prime Broker or the Lender (as defined below) as applicable, a &#147;Bitcoin Counterparty&#148;), to (i) purchase the amount of bitcoin equivalent in value to the cash deposit amount associated
with the order and (ii) deposit the resulting bitcoin deposit amount in the Trust&#146;s account with the Bitcoin Custodian, resulting in the Transfer Agent crediting the applicable amount of Shares to the Authorized Participant. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Authorized Participants may then offer Shares to the public at prices that depend on various factors, including the supply and demand for
Shares, the value of the Trust&#146;s assets, and market conditions at the time of a transaction. Shareholders who buy or sell Shares during the day from their broker on the secondary market may do so at a premium or discount relative to the net
asset value of the Shares of the Trust. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Except when aggregated in Baskets, Shares are not redeemable securities. Baskets are only
redeemable by Authorized Participants. </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate &#150; New York Variant for the Bitcoin &#150; U.S. Dollar trading
pair (the &#147;Index&#148;), produced by CF Benchmarks Ltd., on December 22, 2023 was $43,731.74. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor of the Trust served as the
Seed Capital Investor to the Trust. On December 12, 2023, the Sponsor, in its capacity as Seed Capital Investor, subject to conditions, purchased Seed Creation Baskets comprising 2 Shares at a per-Share price of $50.00, as described in &#147;<I>Seed
Capital Investor</I>.&#148; Total proceeds to the Trust from the sale of these Seed Creation Baskets were $100. Delivery of the Seed Creation Baskets was made on December 12, 2023. These Seed Creation Baskets were redeemed for cash on or about
January 5, 2024. </P>  <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January 9, 2024 (the &#147;Seed Capital Purchase Date&#148;), the Seed Capital Investor purchased the initial Seed
Creation Baskets comprising 10,000 Shares (the &#147;Initial Seed Creation Baskets&#148;) at a per-share price of $46.88. Total proceeds to the Trust from the sale of the Seed Creation Baskets were $468,806.44. On January&nbsp;9, 2024, the Trust
purchased 10 bitcoin with the proceeds of the Seed Creation Baskets by transacting with a Bitcoin Counterparty to acquire bitcoin on behalf of the Trust in exchange for cash provided by the Sponsor in its capacity as Seed Capital Investor. As of the
date of this prospectus, these 10,000 Shares represent all of the outstanding Shares. In its capacity as the Seed Capital Investor, the Sponsor has acted as a statutory underwriter in connection with this purchase. The bitcoin acquired in connection
with the Initial Seed Creation Baskets will be held by the Bitcoin Custodian, and such Shares could be sold at different prices if sold by the Seed Capital Investor at different times. It is anticipated that the Seed Capital Investor will redeem its
Shares or sell its Shares to a third party in the weeks following the initial listing of Shares on the Exchange. The Trust will not receive any of the proceeds of the redemption of any Seed Creation Baskets by the Seed Capital Investor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Shareholders who decide to buy or sell Shares of the Trust will place their trade orders through their brokers and will incur customary
brokerage commissions and charges. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the Shares. The Shares are expected to be listed for trading, subject to notice of issuance, on the Exchange under the ticker symbol &#147;ARKB.&#148;
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The offering of an indeterminate amount of the Trust&#146;s Shares is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
&#147;SEC&#148;) in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;1933 Act&#148;). The offering is intended to be a continuous offering and is not expected to terminate until three years from the date of the original offering,
unless extended as permitted by applicable rules under the 1933 Act. The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;), and is not subject to regulation under the 1940
Act. Investors in the Trust will not, therefore, receive the regulatory protections afforded by investment companies registered under the 1940 Act. The Sponsor is not acting in the capacity of an &#147;Investment Adviser&#148; (as defined in
Section&nbsp;202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;Advisers Act&#148;)), the Sponsor&#146;s provision of services to the Trust will not be governed by the Advisers Act, and the Sponsor is not subject to a fiduciary
standard of care. The Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the &#147;CEA&#148;), and the Sponsor is not subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;)
as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor. Shareholders in the Trust will not benefit from the protections afforded to investors in bitcoin futures contracts on regulated futures markets. The Trust&#146;s Shares are neither
interests in nor obligations of the Sponsor, the Sub-Adviser or the Trustee. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:3pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P><center>

used below, the term &#147;Bitcoin network&#148; is used to describe the system as a whole that is involved in maintaining the ledger of bitcoin ownership and facilitating the transfer of bitcoin among parties. When referring to the digital asset

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (the &#147;Trust&#148;) is an exchange-traded fund that issues common shares of beneficial interest (the
&#147;Shares&#148;) that trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the &#147;Exchange&#148;). The Trust&#146;s investment objective is to seek to track the performance of bitcoin, as measured by the performance of the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate - New
York Variant (the &#147;Index&#148;), adjusted for the Trust&#146;s expenses and other liabilities. The Index is calculated by CF Benchmarks Ltd. (the &#147;Index Provider&#148;) based on an aggregation of executed trade flow of major bitcoin spot
exchanges. The Index is designed to reflect the performance of bitcoin in U.S. dollars. The Index currently uses substantially the same methodology as the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (&#147;BRR&#148;), including utilizing the same six bitcoin
exchanges, which is the underlying rate to determine settlement of CME bitcoin futures contracts, except that the Index is calculated as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (&#147;ET&#148;), whereas the BRR is calculated as of 4:00 p.m. London time.
<I></I><I></I>The Shares of the Trust are valued daily based on the Index. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust will
hold bitcoin. The Trust is sponsored by 21Shares US LLC (the &#147;Sponsor&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amun Holdings Ltd. The Sponsor has entered into a marketing and sub-advisory agreement (the &#147;Support Services Agreement&#148;) with
ARK Investment Management LLC (the &#147;Sub-Adviser&#148;) to serve as the Trust&#146;s sub-adviser and provide assistance in the marketing of the Shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust does not provide investors with direct exposure to spot bitcoin, and an investment in the Trust is not a direct investment in
bitcoin. Rather, the Trust provides investors with the opportunity to indirectly access the market for bitcoin through a traditional brokerage account without the potential barriers to entry or risks involved with holding or transferring bitcoin
directly or acquiring it from a bitcoin spot market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust will custody its bitcoin at a regulated third-party custodian, Coinbase
Custody Trust Company, LLC (&#147;Coinbase Custody&#148; or the &#147;Bitcoin Custodian&#148;). The Bitcoin Custodian is chartered as a New York State limited liability trust company that provides custody services for digital assets. The Bitcoin
Custodian is not Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;)-insured but carries insurance provided by private insurance carriers. The Trust will not invest in derivatives. The Sponsor believes that the Shares are designed to provide
investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in bitcoin without purchasing, holding and trading bitcoin directly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Bitcoin and the

software). Transaction data is permanently recorded in files called &#147;blocks,&#148; which reflect transactions that have been recorded and authenticated by Bitcoin network participants. The Bitcoin network software source code includes protocols

the Trust&#146;s expenses and other liabilities. In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust will hold bitcoin and will value its Shares daily as of 4:00 p.m. ET based on the Index. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Barring the liquidation of the Trust or extraordinary circumstances (including but not limited to, non-recurring expenses and costs of
services performed by the Sponsor or a service provider on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of Shareholders, such as in connection with any fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, any indemnification of agents, service providers or
counterparties of the Trust and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters), the Trust generally will not purchase or sell
bitcoin other than in connection with the creation or redemption of Shares. The Sponsor may also sell bitcoin to pay certain expenses, which may be facilitated by the Prime Broker (as defined below) or any other prime brokers with whom the Trust
contracts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When the Trust sells or redeems its Shares, bitcoin will be transferred into or out of the Trust, as applicable, in exchange
for blocks of 5,000 Shares (a &#147;Basket&#148;) that are based on the quantity of bitcoin attributable to each Share of the Trust (net of accrued but unpaid Sponsor Fees (defined below) and any accrued but unpaid extraordinary expenses or
liabilities). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Financial firms that are authorized to purchase Shares from or redeem Shares to the Trust (known as &#147;Authorized
Participants&#148;) will purchase Shares by depositing cash in the Trust&#146;s account with the Cash Custodian. This will cause the Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust, to automatically instruct a designated third party, who is not an Authorized
Participant but who may be an affiliate of an Authorized Participant and with whom the Sponsor has entered into an agreement on behalf of the Trust (each such third party, or the Prime Broker or Lender, as applicable, a &#147;Bitcoin
Counterparty&#148;), to (i) purchase the amount of bitcoin equivalent in value to the cash deposit amount associated with the order and (ii) deposit the resulting bitcoin deposit amount in the Trust&#146;s account with the Bitcoin Custodian,
resulting in the Transfer Agent crediting the applicable amount of Shares to the Authorized Participant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When such an Authorized
Participant redeems its Shares, the Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust will direct the Bitcoin Custodian to transfer bitcoin to the Bitcoin Counterparty, who will sell the bitcoin to be executed, in the Sponsor&#146;s reasonable efforts, at the Index
price used by the Trust to calculate NAV, taking into account any spread, commissions, or other trading costs and deposit the cash proceeds of such sale in the Trust&#146;s account with the Cash Custodian for settlement with the Authorized
Participant. Any slippage incurred (including, but not limited to, any trading fees, spreads, or commissions), on a cash equivalent basis, will be the responsibility of the Authorized Participant and not of the Trust or Sponsor. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Index, which was introduced on February 28, 2022, is based on materially the same methodology (except calculation time) as the Index
Provider&#146;s BRR, which was first introduced on November 14, 2016, and is the rate on which bitcoin futures contracts are cash-settled in U.S. dollars at the CME. The Index is designed based on the IOSCO Principals for Financial Benchmarks. The
Index Provider is the administrator of the Index. The Index is calculated daily and aggregates the notional value of bitcoin trading activity across major bitcoin spot exchanges. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor believes that the use of the Index is reflective of a reasonable valuation of the average spot price of bitcoin and that
resistance to manipulation is a priority aim of its design methodology. The methodology: (i) takes an observation period and divides it into equal partitions of time; (ii) then calculates the volume-weighted median of all transactions within each
partition; and (iii) the value is determined from the arithmetic mean of the volume-weighted medians, equally weighted. By employing the foregoing steps, the Index thereby seeks to ensure that transactions in bitcoin conducted at outlying prices do
not have an undue effect on the value of a specific partition, that large trades or clusters of trades transacted over a short period of time will not have an undue influence on the index level, and the effect of large trades at prices that deviate
from the prevailing price are mitigated from having an undue influence on the benchmark level. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the Sponsor notes that an
oversight function is implemented by the Index Provider in seeking to ensure that the Index is administered through codified policies for Index integrity, which include a conflicts of interest policy, a control framework, an accountability
framework, and an input data policy. It is also subject to the UK Benchmark Regulation (&#147;BMR&#148;), compliance with which regulations has been subject to a Limited Assurance Audit under the ISAE 3000 standard as of September 12, 2022, which is
publicly available.</P>

Agreement to serve as the Trust&#146;s sub-adviser and to provide assistance in the marketing of the Shares. The Sponsor is responsible for supervising the Sub-Adviser. The Sponsor has agreed to pay all operating expenses (except for litigation

Sponsor and the Sub-Adviser do not actively manage the bitcoin held by the Trust. This means that the Sponsor and the Sub-Adviser do not sell bitcoin at times when its price is high or acquire bitcoin at low prices in the expectation of future price
increases. It also means that the Sponsor and the Sub-Adviser do not make use of any of the hedging techniques available to professional bitcoin investors to attempt to reduce the risks of losses resulting from price decreases. The Sponsor has

York Department of Financial Services. The Bitcoin Custodian is subject to extensive regulation and has among the longest track records in the industry of providing custodial services for digital asset private keys. The Trust&#146;s assets with the
Bitcoin Custodian are held in segregated accounts on the Bitcoin blockchain, commonly referred to as &#147;wallets,&#148; and are therefore not commingled with corporate or other customer assets. The segregated account in which the Bitcoin Custodian
will custody all of the Trust&#146;s bitcoin from time to time is hereinafter referred to as the Trust&#146;s &#147;Vault Balance.&#148; The Bitcoin Custodian will keep a substantial portion of the private keys associated with the Trust&#146;s

cold storage of the Bitcoin Custodian on an ongoing basis, but a portion of the Trust&#146;s assets may be held in hot trading wallets, from time to time, in connection with the settlement of a creation or redemption transaction. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bitcoin has a relatively limited history of existence and operations compared to traditional commodities. There is a limited established
performance record for the price of bitcoin and, in turn, a limited basis for evaluating an investment in bitcoin. Although past performance is not necessarily indicative of future result, if bitcoin had a more established history, such history
might (or might not) provide investors with more information on which to evaluate an investment in the Trust. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Bitcoin generally.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market value of bitcoin is not related to any specific company, government or asset. The valuation of bitcoin depends on
future expectations for the value of the Bitcoin network, the number of bitcoin transactions, and the overall usage of bitcoin as an asset. This means that a significant amount of the value of bitcoin is speculative, which could lead to increased
volatility. Investors could experience significant gains, losses and/or volatility in the Trust&#146;s holdings, depending on the valuation of bitcoin. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Several factors may affect the price of bitcoin, including, but not limited to, supply and demand, investors&#146; expectations with respect
to the rate of inflation, interest rates, currency exchange rates or future regulatory measures (if any) that restrict the trading of bitcoin or the use of bitcoin as a form of payment. The issuance of bitcoin is determined by a computer code, not
by a central bank, and prices can be extremely volatile. For instance, during the period from December&nbsp;17, 2017, to December&nbsp;14, 2018, bitcoin experienced a decline of roughly 84%, and experienced a similar decline in value from November
2021 to June 2022. There is no assurance that bitcoin will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future, or that acceptance of bitcoin payments by mainstream retail merchants and commercial businesses will continue to
grow. The value of the Trust&#146;s investments in bitcoin could decline rapidly, including to zero. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Limits on bitcoin supply.

number of bitcoin grows at a limited rate pursuant to a pre-set schedule. The number of bitcoin awarded for solving a new block is automatically halved after every 210,000 blocks are added to the Bitcoin blockchain, approximately every 4 years.
Currently, the fixed reward for solving a new block is 6.25 bitcoin per block and this is expected to decrease by half to become 3.125 bitcoin in approximately early 2024. This deliberately controlled rate of bitcoin creation means that the number
of bitcoin in existence will increase at a controlled rate until the number of bitcoin in existence reaches the pre-determined 21 million bitcoin. However, the 21 million supply cap could be changed in a hard fork. As of November 2023, approximately
19&nbsp;million bitcoin were outstanding and the date when the 21 million Bitcoin limitation will be reached is estimated to be the year 2140. </P>

volatility in recent periods and may continue to do so. For instance, there were steep increases in the value of certain digital assets, including bitcoin, over the course of 2021, and multiple market observers asserted that digital assets were
experiencing a &#147;bubble.&#148; These increases were followed by steep drawdowns throughout 2022 in digital asset trading prices, including for bitcoin. These episodes of rapid price appreciation followed by steep drawdowns have occurred multiple
times throughout bitcoin&#146;s history, including in 2011, 2013-2014, and 2017-2018, before repeating again in 2021-2022. Over the course of 2023, bitcoin prices have continued to exhibit extreme volatility. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Extreme volatility may persist, and the value of the Shares may significantly decline in the future without recovery. The digital asset
markets may still be experiencing a bubble or may experience a bubble again in the future. For example, in the first half of 2022, each of Celsius Network, Voyager Digital Ltd., and Three Arrows Capital declared bankruptcy, resulting in a loss of
confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly. In November 2022, FTX Trading Ltd. (&#147;FTX&#148;), one of the largest digital asset exchanges by volume at the time, halted
customer withdrawals amid rumors of the company&#146;s liquidity issues and likely insolvency, which were subsequently corroborated by its CEO. Shortly thereafter, FTX&#146;s CEO resigned, and FTX and many of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy in
the United States, while other affiliates have entered insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceedings around the globe, following which the U.S. Department of Justice brought criminal fraud and other charges, and the SEC and CFTC brought civil
securities and commodities fraud charges, against certain of FTX&#146;s and its affiliates&#146; senior executives, including its former CEO, who was found guilty of these criminal charges in November 2023. In addition, several other entities in the
digital asset industry filed for bankruptcy following FTX&#146;s bankruptcy filing, such as BlockFi Inc. and Genesis Global Capital, LLC (&#147;Genesis&#148;). In response to these events (collectively, the &#147;2022 Events&#148;), the digital
asset markets have experienced extreme price volatility and other entities in the digital asset industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected, further undermining confidence in the digital asset markets. These events have also
negatively impacted the liquidity of the digital asset markets as certain entities affiliated with FTX engaged in significant trading activity. If the liquidity of the digital asset markets continues to be negatively impacted by these events,
digital asset prices, including bitcoin, may continue to experience significant volatility or price declines, and confidence in the digital asset markets may be further undermined. In addition, regulatory and enforcement scrutiny has increased,
including from, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the CFTC, the White House and Congress, as well as state regulators and authorities. These events are continuing to develop, and the full facts are continuing to emerge. It is
not possible to predict at this time all of the risks that they may pose to the Trust, its service providers or to the digital asset industry as a whole. </P>

regulated trading platforms, such as national securities exchanges or designated contract markets. Many digital asset exchanges are unlicensed, unregulated, operate without extensive supervision by governmental authorities, and do not provide the
public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management team, corporate practices, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance. In particular, those located outside the United States may be subject to significantly less
stringent regulatory and compliance requirements in their local jurisdictions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, trading activity on or reported by these
digital asset exchanges is generally significantly less regulated than trading in regulated U.S. securities and commodities markets and may reflect behavior that would be prohibited in regulated U.S. trading venues. Furthermore, many spot markets
lack certain safeguards put in place by more traditional exchanges to enhance the stability of trading on the exchange and prevent flash crashes, such as limit-down circuit breakers. As a result, the prices of digital assets such as bitcoin on
digital asset exchanges may be subject to larger and/or more frequent sudden declines than assets traded on more traditional exchanges. Tools to detect and deter fraudulent or manipulative trading activities (such as market manipulation,
front-running of trades, and wash-trading) may not be available to or employed by digital asset exchanges or may not exist at all. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, these venues. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">No bitcoin exchange is immune from these risks. While the Trust itself does not buy or sell bitcoin on bitcoin spot markets, the closure or
temporary shutdown of bitcoin exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may reduce confidence in the Bitcoin network and can slow down the mass adoption of bitcoin. Further, spot market failures
or that of any other major component of the overall bitcoin ecosystem can have an adverse effect on bitcoin markets and the price of bitcoin and could therefore have a negative impact on the performance of the Trust. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Negative perception, a lack of stability in the bitcoin spot markets, manipulation of bitcoin spot markets by customers and/or the closure or
temporary shutdown of such exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may reduce confidence in bitcoin generally and result in greater volatility in the market price of bitcoin and the Shares of
the Trust. Furthermore, the closure or temporary shutdown of a bitcoin spot market may impact the Trust&#146;s ability to determine the value of its bitcoin holdings or for the Trust&#146;s Authorized Participants to effectively arbitrage the

failing to function as efficiently as it otherwise would, leading to the potential for the Shares to trade at premiums or discounts to the NAV per Share, and such premiums or discounts could be substantial. Furthermore, if cash creations or
redemptions are unavailable, either due to the Sponsor&#146;s decision to reject or suspend such orders or otherwise, it will not be possible for Authorized Participants to redeem or create Shares, in which case the arbitrage mechanism would be
unavailable. This could result in impaired liquidity for the Shares, wider bid/ask spreads in secondary trading of the Shares and greater costs to investors and other market participants. In addition, the Trust&#146;s inability to facilitate in-kind

could cause delays in trade execution due to potential operational issues arising from implementing a cash creation and redemption model, which involves greater operational steps (and therefore execution risk) than the originally contemplated
in-kind creation and redemption model, or the potential unavailability or exhaustion of the Trade Credits, which the Trust would not be able to use in connection with in-kind creations and redemptions. Such delays could cause the execution price
associated with such trades to materially deviate from the Index price used to determine the NAV. Even though the Authorized Participant is responsible for the dollar cost of such difference in prices, Authorized Participants could default on their
obligations to the Trust, or such potential risks and costs could lead to Authorized Participants, who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem Baskets to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the
price of the Shares and the price of the underlying bitcoin, to elect to not participate in the Trust&#146;s Share creation and redemption processes. This may adversely affect the arbitrage mechanism intended to keep the price of the Shares closely
linked to the price of bitcoin, and as a result, the price of the Shares may fall or otherwise diverge from NAV. If the arbitrage mechanism is not effective, purchases or sales of Shares on the secondary market could occur at a premium or discount
to NAV, which could harm Shareholders by causing them buy Shares at a price higher than the value of the underlying bitcoin held by the Trust or sell Shares at a price lower than the value of the underlying bitcoin held by the Trust, causing
Shareholders to suffer losses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the knowledge of the Sponsor, exchange-traded products for spot-market commodities other than bitcoin,
such as gold and silver, generally employ in-kind creations and redemptions with the underlying asset. The Sponsor believes that it is generally more efficient, and therefore less costly, for spot commodity exchange-traded products to utilize
in-kind orders rather than cash orders, because there are fewer steps in the process and therefore there is less operational risk involved when an authorized participant can manage the buying and selling of the underlying asset itself, rather than
depend on an unaffiliated party such as the issuer or sponsor of the exchange-traded product. As such, a spot commodity exchange-traded product that only employs cash creations and redemptions and does not permit in-kind creations and redemptions is
a novel product that has not been tested, and could be impacted by any resulting operational inefficiencies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If the process of

(which depend on timely transfers of bitcoin to and by the Bitcoin Custodian) encounter any unanticipated difficulties due to, for example, the price volatility of bitcoin, the insolvency, business failure or interruption, default, failure to
perform, security breach, or other problems affecting the Bitcoin Custodian, any operational issues that may arise from creating and redeeming Shares via cash transactions, the closing of bitcoin trading platforms due to fraud, failures, security
breaches or otherwise, or network outages or congestion, spikes in transaction fees demanded by miners, or other problems or disruptions affecting the Bitcoin network, then potential market participants, such as the Authorized Participants and their
customers, who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem Baskets to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the price of the Shares and the price of the underlying bitcoin may not take the risk that, as
a result of those difficulties, they may not be able to realize the profit they expect. In certain such cases, the Sponsor may suspend the process of creation and redemption of Baskets. During such times, trading spreads, and the resulting premium
or discount, on Shares may widen. Alternatively, in the case of a network outage or other problems affecting the Bitcoin network, the processing of transactions on the Bitcoin network may be disrupted, which in turn could affect the creation or
redemption of Baskets. If this is the case, the liquidity of the Shares may decline and the price of the Shares may fluctuate independently of the price of bitcoin and may fall or otherwise diverge from NAV. Furthermore, in the event that the market
for bitcoin should become relatively illiquid and thereby materially restrict opportunities for arbitraging by delivering bitcoin in return for Baskets, the price of Shares may diverge from the value of bitcoin. </P>

Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in late February 2014, demonstrated that even the largest digital asset exchanges could be subject to abrupt failure with consequences for both users of digital asset exchanges and the digital
asset industry as a whole. In particular, in the two weeks that followed the February 7, 2014, halt of bitcoin withdrawals from Mt. Gox, the value of one bitcoin fell on other exchanges from around $795 on February 6, 2014, to $578 on February 20,
2014. Additionally, in January 2015, Bitstamp announced that approximately 19,000 bitcoin had been stolen from its operational or &#147;hot&#148; wallets. Further, in August 2016, it was reported that almost 120,000 bitcoin worth around $78 million
were stolen from Bitfinex, a large digital asset exchange. The value of bitcoin and other digital assets immediately decreased over 10% following reports of the theft at Bitfinex. In July 2017, FinCEN assessed a $110 million fine against BTC-E, a
now defunct digital asset exchange, for facilitating crimes such as drug sales and ransomware attacks. In addition, in December 2017, Yapian, the operator of Seoul-based cryptocurrency exchange Youbit, suspended digital asset trading and filed for
bankruptcy following a hack that resulted in a loss of 17% of Yapian&#146;s assets. Following the hack, Youbit users were allowed to withdraw approximately 75% of the digital assets in their exchange accounts, with any potential further
distributions to be made following Yapian&#146;s pending bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, in January 2018, the Japanese digital asset exchange, Coincheck, was hacked, resulting in losses of approximately $535 million, and in February 2018, the
Italian digital asset exchange, Bitgrail, was hacked, resulting in approximately $170 million in losses. In May 2019, one of the world&#146;s largest digital asset exchanges, Binance, was hacked, resulting in losses of approximately $40 million.

variety of manipulative or fraudulent practices. Other academics and market observers have put forth evidence to support claims that manipulative trading activity has occurred on certain bitcoin exchanges. For example, in a 2017 paper titled
&#147;Price Manipulation in the Bitcoin Ecosystem&#148; sponsored by the Interdisciplinary Cyber Research Center at Tel Aviv University, a group of researchers used publicly available trading data, as well as leaked transaction data from a 2014 Mt.

$1,000 over a two-month period. In August 2017, it was reported that a trader or group of traders nicknamed &#147;Spoofy&#148; was placing large orders on Bitfinex without actually executing them, presumably in order to influence other investors
into buying or selling by creating a false appearance that greater demand existed in the market. In December 2017, an anonymous blogger (publishing under the pseudonym Bitfinex&#146;d) cited publicly available trading data to support his or her

improve their attractiveness to investors who look for maximum liquidity, or it may be motivated by the ability to attract listing fees from token issuers who seek the most liquid and high-volume exchanges on which to list their coins. Results of

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Spot markets on which bitcoin trades may be susceptible to &#147;front-running,&#148; which refers to the process when someone
uses technology or market advantage to get prior knowledge of upcoming transactions. Front-running is a frequent activity on centralized as well as decentralized exchanges. By using bots functioning on a millisecond-scale timeframe, bad actors are
able to take advantage of the forthcoming price movement and make economic gains at the cost of those who had introduced these transactions. The objective of a front runner is to buy a chunk of tokens at a low price and later sell them at a higher
price while simultaneously exiting the position. Front-running happens via manipulations of gas prices or timestamps, also known as slow matching. To extent that front-running occurs, it may result in investor frustrations and concerns as to the
price integrity of digital asset exchanges and digital assets more generally. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Momentum pricing. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market value of bitcoin is not based on any kind of claim, nor backed by any physical asset. Instead, the market value depends on the
expectation of being usable in future transactions and continued interest from investors. This strong correlation between an expectation and market value is the basis for the current (and probable future) volatility of the market value of bitcoin
and may increase the likelihood of momentum pricing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Momentum pricing typically is associated with growth stocks and other assets whose
valuation, as determined by the investing public, is impacted by appreciation in value. Momentum pricing may result in speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of digital assets, which inflates prices and leads to increased volatility.
As a result, bitcoin may be more likely to fluctuate in value due to changing investor confidence in future appreciation or depreciation in prices, which could adversely affect the price of bitcoin, and, in turn, an investment in the Trust. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The value of a bitcoin as represented by the Index may also be subject to momentum pricing due to speculation regarding future appreciation in
value, leading to greater volatility that could adversely affect the value of the Shares. Momentum pricing of bitcoin has previously resulted, and may continue to result, in speculation regarding future appreciation or depreciation in the value of
bitcoin, further contributing to volatility and potentially inflating prices at any given time. These dynamics may impact the value of an investment in Trust. </P>

bitcoin and the Bitcoin network could adversely affect an investment in Shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The further development and acceptance of the Bitcoin
network, which is part of a new and rapidly changing industry, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. For example, the Bitcoin network faces significant obstacles to increasing the usage of bitcoin without resulting in
higher fees or slower transaction settlement times, and attempts to increase the volume of transactions may not be effective. The slowing, stopping or reversing of the development or acceptance of the Bitcoin network may adversely affect the price
of bitcoin and therefore an investment in the Shares. The further adoption of bitcoin will require growth in its usage and in the Bitcoin network. Adoption of bitcoin will also require an accommodating regulatory environment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The use of bitcoin to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services is part of a new and rapidly evolving industry that employs digital
assets based upon computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocols. Bitcoin is a prominent, but not unique, part of this industry. The growth of this industry is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, as new assets and technological
innovations continue to develop and evolve. Currently, there is relatively limited use of bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively extensive use as a store of value, thus contributing to price volatility that
could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. However, bitcoin may not be suited for a number of commercial uses, including those requiring real time payments, partially due to the amount of time that bitcoin transactions may potentially
require in order to clear. This could result in decreasing usage of the network, to the extent that bitcoin does not otherwise become a store of value asset or meet the needs of another commercial use. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Today, there is limited use of bitcoin in the retail, commercial, or payments spaces, and, on a relative basis, speculators make up a
significant portion of users. Certain merchants and major retail and commercial businesses have only recently begun accepting bitcoin and the Bitcoin network as a means of payment for goods and services. This pattern may contribute to outsized price
volatility, which in turn can make bitcoin less attractive to merchants and commercial parties as a means of payment. A lack of expansion by bitcoin into retail and commercial markets or a contraction of such use may result in a reduction in the
price of bitcoin, which could adversely affect an investment in the Trust. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, there is no assurance that bitcoin will maintain
its value over the long-term. The value of bitcoin is subject to risks related to its usage. Even if growth in bitcoin adoption occurs in the near or medium-term, there is no assurance that bitcoin usage will continue to grow over the long-term. A
contraction in use of bitcoin may result in increased volatility or a reduction in the price of bitcoin, which would adversely impact the value of Shares. </P>

deposit accounts, in excess of the insured amount. On May 1, 2023, First Republic Bank was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the FDIC as receiver. Following a bidding process, the FDIC

cryptographic protocol to govern the interactions within the Bitcoin network. A loose community of core developers has evolved to informally manage the source code for the protocol. Membership in the community of core developers evolves over time,
largely based on self-determined participation in the resource section dedicated to the Bitcoin network on <U>Github.com</U>. The core developers can propose amendments to the Bitcoin network&#146;s source code that, if accepted by miners and users,
could alter the protocols and software of the Bitcoin network and the properties of bitcoin. These alterations occur through software upgrades and could potentially include changes to the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining
of new bitcoin, which could undermine the appeal and market value of bitcoin. Alternatively, software upgrades and other changes to the protocols of the Bitcoin network could fail to work as intended or could introduce bugs, security risks, or

largely on the GitHub resource section dedicated to development of the Bitcoin network. As the Bitcoin network protocol is not sold or made available subject to licensing or subscription fees and its use does not generate revenues for its
development team, the core developers are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating the source code for the Bitcoin network protocol. Consequently, there is a lack of financial incentive for developers to maintain or develop the Bitcoin
network and the core developers may lack the resources to adequately address emerging issues with the Bitcoin network protocol. Although the Bitcoin network is currently supported by the core developers, there can be no guarantee that such support
will continue or be sufficient in the future. Alternatively, entities whose interests are at odds with other participants in the Bitcoin network may seek to obtain control over the Bitcoin network by influencing core developers. For example,
malicious actors could attempt to bribe a core developer or group of core developers to propose certain changes to the network core developers. In addition, a bad actor could also attempt to interfere with the operation of the Bitcoin network by
attempting to exercise a malign influence over a core developer. To the extent that material issues arise with the Bitcoin network protocol and the core developers and open-source contributors are unable to address the issues adequately or in a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bitcoin, along with many other digital assets, are open-source projects. The infrastructure and ecosystem that powers the Bitcoin network are
developed by different parties, including affiliated and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-affiliated</FONT> engineers, developers, miners, platform developers, evangelists, marketers, exchange operators and other companies based around a service
regarding bitcoin, each of whom may have different motivations, drivers, philosophies and incentives. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, any individual can
propose refinements or improvements to the Bitcoin network&#146;s source code through one or more software upgrades that could alter the protocols governing the Bitcoin network and the properties of bitcoin. When a modification is proposed and a
substantial majority of users and miners consent to the modification, the change is implemented, and the Bitcoin network remains uninterrupted. However, a &#147;hard fork&#148; occurs if less than a substantial majority of users and miners consent
to the proposed modification, and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification. In other words, two incompatible networks would then exist: (1)&nbsp;one network running the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-modified</FONT> software and (2)&nbsp;another network running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of bitcoin running in parallel, and the creation of a new
digital asset which lacks interchangeability with its predecessor. This is in contrast to a &#147;soft fork,&#148; or a proposed modification to the software governing the network that results in a post-update network that is compatible with the
network as it existed prior to the update, because it restricts the network operations that can be performed after the update. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Forks
occur for a variety of reasons. A fork could occur after a significant security breach. Participants on the network could elect to &#147;fork&#148; the network to its state before the hack, effectively reversing the hack. A fork could also be
introduced by an unintentional, unanticipated software flaw in the multiple versions of otherwise compatible software users run. Such a fork could adversely affect bitcoin&#146;s viability. It is possible, however, that a substantial number of users
and miners could adopt an incompatible version of the digital asset while resisting <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">community-led</FONT> efforts to merge the two chains. This would result in a permanent fork. For example, in July 2016, Ethereum
&#147;forked&#148; into Ethereum and a new digital asset, Ethereum Classic, as a result of the Ethereum network community&#146;s response to a significant security breach in which an anonymous hacker exploited a smart contract running on the
Ethereum network to syphon approximately $60 million of ETH held by the DAO, a distributed autonomous organization, into a segregated account. In response to the hack, most participants in the Ethereum community elected to adopt a &#147;fork&#148;
that effectively reversed the hack. However, a minority of users continued to develop the original blockchain, now referred to as &#147;Ethereum Classic&#148; with the digital asset on that blockchain now referred to as Ethereum Classic, or ETC. ETC
now trades on several digital asset exchanges. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A fork may occur as a result of disagreement among network participants as to whether a
proposed modification to the network should be accepted. For example, on August&nbsp;1, 2017, after extended debates among developers as to how to improve the Bitcoin network&#146;s transaction capacity, the Bitcoin network was forked by a group of
developers and miners resulting in the creation of a new blockchain, which underlies the new digital asset &#147;Bitcoin Cash.&#148; Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash now operate on separate, independent blockchains. Since then, the Bitcoin network has
forked several times to launch new digital assets, such as Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Silver and Bitcoin Diamond. Litecoin was also the result of a fork from the original Bitcoin blockchain. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Significant forks are typically announced several months in advance. The circumstances of each fork are unique, and their relative
significance varies. It is possible that a particular fork may result in a significant disruption to bitcoin and, potentially, may result in broader market disruption should pricing become difficult following the fork. It is not possible to predict
with accuracy the impact that any anticipated fork could have or for how long any resulting disruption may exist. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Forks may have a
detrimental effect on the value of bitcoin, including by negatively affecting cryptocurrency allocations or by failing to capture of the full value of the newly-forked bitcoin if it is excluded from the Index. Forks can also introduce new security
risks. For example, forks may result in &#147;replay attacks,&#148; or </P>

asset networks, split in July 2016, replay attacks, in which transactions from one network were rebroadcast to nefarious effect on the other network, plagued Ethereum exchanges through at least October 2016. An Ethereum exchange announced in July
2016 that it had lost 40,000 Ethereum Classic, worth about $100,000 at that time, as a result of replay attacks. Similar replay attack concerns occurred in connection with the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV networks split in November 2018. Another
possible result of a hard fork is an inherent decrease in the level of security due to significant amounts of mining power remaining on one network or migrating instead to the new forked network. After a hard fork, it may become easier for an
individual miner or mining pool&#146;s hashing power to exceed 50% of the processing power of a digital asset network that retained or attracted less mining power, thereby making digital assets that rely on proof-of-work more susceptible to attack.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A hard fork may adversely affect the price of bitcoin at the time of announcement or adoption. For example, the announcement of a hard
fork could lead to increased demand for the pre fork digital asset, in anticipation that ownership of the pre fork digital asset would entitle holders to a new digital asset following the fork. The increased demand for the pre fork digital asset may
cause the price of the digital asset to rise. After the hard fork, it is possible the aggregate price of the two versions of the digital asset running in parallel would be less than the price of the digital asset immediately prior to the fork.
Furthermore, while the Sponsor will, as permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, determine which network is generally accepted as the Bitcoin network and should therefore be considered the appropriate network for the Trust&#146;s purposes,
there is no guarantee that the Sponsor will choose the network and the associated digital asset that is ultimately the most valuable fork. Either of these events could therefore adversely impact the value of the Shares. When Bitcoin Cash forked from
the Bitcoin network, the value of Bitcoin went from $2,800 to $2,700. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In principle, a hard fork could change the source code for the
Bitcoin network, including the source code which limits the supply of bitcoin to 21 million. Although many observers believe this is unlikely at present, there is no guarantee that the current 21 million supply cap for outstanding bitcoin, which is
estimated to be reached by approximately the year 2140, will not be changed. If a hard fork changing the 21 million supply cap is widely adopted, the limit on the supply of bitcoin could be lifted, which could have an adverse impact on the value of
bitcoin and the value of the Shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If bitcoin were to fork into two digital assets, the Trust may hold, in addition to its existing
bitcoin balance, a right to claim an equivalent amount of the new &#147;forked&#148; asset following the hard fork. However, the Index does not track forks involving bitcoin. The Trust has adopted procedures to address situations involving a fork
that results in the issuance of new alternative bitcoin that the Trust may receive. The holder of bitcoin has no discretion in a hard fork; it merely has the right to claim the new bitcoin on a pro rata basis while it continues to hold the same
number of bitcoin. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Airdrops. </I></P>

digital asset announce to holders of another digital asset that they will be entitled to claim a certain amount of the new digital asset for free, based on the fact that they hold such other digital asset. For example, in March 2017, the promoters
of Stellar Lumens announced that anyone that owned bitcoin as of June 26, 2017, could claim, until August 27, 2017, a certain amount of Stellar Lumens. Airdrops are not included in the Index under its current methodology. See &#147;<I>Prospectus

products such as the Trust, are exposed to an elevated risk of fraud and loss, including, but not limited to, through cyber-attacks. Bitcoin can be stolen, and bitcoin stored in a digital wallet, accessible via private key, can be compromised. While
digital wallets do not store or contain the actual bitcoin, they store public and private keys, which are used as an address for receiving bitcoin or for spending the bitcoin, with both forms of transactions recorded on the public immutable ledger,
the blockchain. By using the private key, a person is able to spend bitcoin, effectively sending it away from the account and recording that transaction on the blockchain. If a private key is compromised, bitcoin associated with that specific public
key may be stolen. Unlike traditional banking transactions, once a transaction has been added to the blockchain, it cannot be reversed. Several exchanges specializing in sales of bitcoin, for example, have already had their operations impacted by
cyber-attacks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Thefts and cyber-attacks can have a negative impact on the reputation, market price, value, or liquidity of bitcoin.
Through investment in the Trust, investors would be indirectly exposed to the risk and potential impact of a cyber-attack. A loss associated with cyberattack, including a total loss, is possible. While the Sponsor and the Bitcoin Custodian have
taken reasonable measures to prevent a theft or hacking of the Trust&#146;s bitcoin holdings, such an event cannot be fully excluded from the Trust&#146;s overall market exposure, and the losses associated with such an event would be borne by
investors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Digital asset networks, including the Bitcoin network, are subject to control by entities that capture a significant amount of

the network mining power (known as hash power) of a particular blockchain network, this control could be used to undertake harmful acts. Such an attack is called a &#147;51%&#148; attack. For example, an individual or group controlling a majority of
the Bitcoin network could prevent transactions from posting accurately, or at all, on the blockchain. It could be possible for the malicious actor to control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new bitcoin
or transactions. Further, a bad actor could &#147;double-spend&#148; its own bitcoin (i.e., spend the same bitcoin in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users&#146; transactions for so long as it maintained control. To
the extent that such malicious actor or botnet did not yield its control of the processing power on the Bitcoin network or the network community did not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the blockchain may not
be possible. Further, a malicious actor or botnet could create a flood of transactions in order to slow down confirmations of transactions on the Bitcoin network. </P>

past, mining pools have gained control of significant amounts of the processing power or &#147;hash rate&#148; of the Bitcoin network. If a mining pool obtains control of more than 50% of the hash rate of the Bitcoin network, a malicious actor would
be able to gain full control of the network and the ability to alter the blockchain. During May and June 2014, mining pool gHash.IO&#146;s processing power approached and, during a twenty-four to forty-eight hour period, may have exceeded 50% of the
processing power on the Bitcoin network. Although no malicious activity or abnormal transaction recording was observed at the time, the incident focused attention on the influence of mining pools. Mining pools have become increasingly concentrated

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A 51% attack is more likely to happen in the context of digital assets with smaller market capitalizations due to the reduced computing power
threshold required to control a majority of a given network. Nevertheless, it is theoretically possible, albeit computationally expensive, to mount a similar 51% attack on bitcoin or other digital assets with large market capitalization. If the

Trust does not invest in stablecoins, it may nonetheless be exposed to these and other risks that stablecoins pose for the bitcoin market through its investment in bitcoin. Stablecoins are digital assets designed to have a stable value over time as
compared to typically volatile digital assets and are typically marketed as being pegged to a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar. Although the prices of stablecoins are intended to be stable, in many cases their prices fluctuate, sometimes
significantly. This volatility has in the past apparently impacted the price of bitcoin. Stablecoins are a relatively new phenomenon, and it is impossible to know all of the risks that they could pose to participants in the bitcoin market. In
addition, some have argued that some stablecoins, particularly Tether, are improperly issued without sufficient backing in a way that could cause artificial rather than genuine demand for bitcoin, raising its price, and also argue that those
associated with certain stablecoins are involved in laundering money. On February&nbsp;17, 2021, the New York Attorney General entered an agreement with Tether&#146;s operators, requiring them to cease any further trading activity with New&nbsp;York
persons and pay $18.5&nbsp;million in penalties for false and misleading statements made regarding the assets backing Tether. On October 15, 2021, the CFTC announced a settlement with Tether&#146;s operators in which they agreed to pay $42.5 million
in fines to settle charges that, among others, Tether&#146;s claims that it maintained sufficient U.S. dollar reserves to back every Tether stablecoin in circulation with the &#147;equivalent amount of corresponding fiat currency&#148; held by
Tether were untrue. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stablecoins are reliant on the U.S. banking system and U.S. treasuries, and the failure of either to function

may choose to mine the alternative new bitcoin resulting from the fork, thus reducing processing power on the original blockchain. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, the incentives for miners to contribute processing power to the Bitcoin network is set to decrease over time. As a result of the
Bitcoin network&#146;s &#147;halving&#148; mechanism, the block reward that miners receive for successfully mining a block are cut in half each time the Bitcoin network mines 210,000 blocks. This type of &#147;halving&#148; event generally occurs
once every four years and will continue until the maximum possible 21&nbsp;million bitcoin have been mined and released into circulation. Currently, there are approximately 19 million bitcoin that have been mined and are in circulation. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If transaction confirmation fees become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to use bitcoin. This may result in decreased usage and
limit expansion of the Bitcoin network in the retail, commercial and payments space, adversely impacting investment in the Trust. Conversely, if the reward for miners or the value of the transaction fees is insufficient to motivate miners, they may
cease expending processing power for any blockchain to solve blocks and confirm transactions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ultimately, if the awards of new bitcoin
for solving blocks declines and transaction fees for recording transactions are not sufficiently high to incentivize miners, or if the costs of validating transactions grow disproportionately, miners may operate at a loss, transition to other
networks, or cease operations altogether. Each of these outcomes could, in turn, slow transaction validation and usage, which could have a negative impact on the Bitcoin network and could adversely affect the value of the bitcoin held by the Trust.

blockchain. Reductions in processing power could result in material, though temporary, delays in transaction confirmation time. Any reduction in confidence in the transaction verification process or mining processing power may adversely impact the

these operations are performed by various machines with varying levels of efficiency, the process consumes a significant amount of energy. The operations of the Bitcoin network and other digital asset networks may also consume significant amounts of
energy. Further, in addition to the direct energy costs of performing calculations on any given digital asset network, there are indirect costs that impact a network&#146;s total energy consumption, including the costs of cooling the machines that

each transaction they confirm. Miners validate unconfirmed transactions by adding the previously unconfirmed transactions to new blocks in the blockchain. Miners are not forced to confirm any specific transaction, but they are economically
incentivized to confirm valid transactions as a means of collecting fees. To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, such transactions will not be recorded on the Bitcoin network until a block is solved by a miner
who does not require the payment of transaction fees. Miners have historically accepted relatively low transaction confirmation fees, because miners have a very low marginal cost of validating unconfirmed transactions. If miners collude in an
anticompetitive manner to reject low transaction fees, then bitcoin users could be forced to pay higher fees, thus reducing the attractiveness of the Bitcoin network, or to wait longer times for their transactions to be validated by a miner who does
not require the payment of a transaction fee. Bitcoin mining occurs globally, and it may be difficult for authorities to apply antitrust regulations across multiple jurisdictions. Any collusion among miners may adversely impact an investment in the

may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. Significant capital is necessary for mining operations to acquire this hardware, lease operating space (often in data centers or warehousing facilities),
afford electricity costs and employ technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than prior Bitcoin network validators and have more defined, regular expenses and liabilities. In

locate an appropriate hedge counterparty, etc.), such conditions may make it difficult for Authorized Participants to create or redeem Baskets (or cause them to not create or redeem Baskets). In addition, the hedging mechanisms employed by Bitcoin
Counterparties to hedge their exposure to bitcoin may not function as intended, which may make it more difficult for them to enter into such transactions. Such events could negatively impact the market price of Shares and the spread at which Shares
trade on the open market. To the extent Bitcoin Counterparties wish to use futures to hedge their exposure, note that while growing in recent years, the market for exchange-traded bitcoin futures has a limited trading history and operational
experience and may be less liquid, more volatile and more vulnerable to economic, market and industry changes than more established futures markets. The liquidity of the market will depend on, among other things, the adoption of bitcoin and the
commercial and speculative interest in the market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Arbitrage transactions intended to keep the price of Shares closely linked to

difficulties, they may not be able to realize the profit they expect. If this is the case, the liquidity of Shares may decline, and the price of the Shares may fluctuate independently of the price of bitcoin and may fall. </P>

computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in relation to digital assets. Multiple thefts of bitcoin and other digital assets from other holders have occurred in the past. Because of the decentralized process for
transferring bitcoin, thefts can be difficult to trace, which may make bitcoin a particularly attractive target for theft. Cyber security failures or breaches of one or more of the Trust&#146;s service providers (including but not limited to, the
Index Provider, the Transfer Agent, the Administrator, or the Bitcoin Custodian) have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, violations of applicable privacy and other laws,
regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Trust and its service providers&#146; use of internet, technology and information systems (including mobile devices and cloud-based service offerings) may expose the Trust to potential risks linked to cyber-security breaches of those technological

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor has evaluated the security procedures in place for safeguarding the Trust&#146;s bitcoin. Nevertheless, the security procedures
cannot guarantee the prevention of any loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God that may be borne by the Trust. Access to the Trust&#146;s bitcoin could be restricted by natural events (such as an earthquake or flood) or human
actions (such as a terrorist attack). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The security procedures and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of
outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee of the Sponsor, the Sub-Adviser, the Bitcoin Custodian, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Trust&#146;s account with the Bitcoin Custodian, the private
keys (and therefore bitcoin) or other data of the Trust. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of the Sponsor, the Sub-Adviser, the Bitcoin Custodian, or the Trust&#146;s other service providers to disclose
sensitive information in order to gain access to the Trust&#146;s infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a
predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Sponsor and the Bitcoin Custodian may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An actual or perceived breach of the Trust&#146;s account with the Bitcoin Custodian could harm the Trust&#146;s operations, result in partial
or total loss of the Trust&#146;s assets, damage the Trust&#146;s reputation and negatively affect the market perception of the effectiveness of the Trust, all of which could in turn reduce demand for the Shares, resulting in a reduction in the
price of the Shares. The Trust may also cease operations, the occurrence of which could similarly result in a reduction in the price of the Shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the Sponsor has established business continuity plans and systems that it believes are reasonably designed to prevent cyber attacks,
there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems including the possibility that certain risks have not been, or cannot be, identified. Service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Trust, which could be negatively
impacted as a result. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Trust&#146;s holdings of bitcoin are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable
to the Trust, the responsible party may not have the financial resources, including insurance coverage, sufficient to satisfy the Trust&#146;s claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for the Trust may be
limited to the relevant custodian or, to the extent identifiable, other responsible third parties (for example, a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid
claim of the Trust. Similarly, as noted below, the Trust&#146;s Bitcoin Custodian has extraordinarily limited liability to the Trust, which will adversely affect the Trust&#146;s ability to seek recovery from them, even when they are at fault. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It may not be possible, either because of a lack of available policies or because of prohibitive cost, for the Trust to obtain insurance that
would cover losses of the Trust&#146;s bitcoin. If an uninsured loss occurs or a loss exceeds policy limits, the Trust could lose all of its assets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The Trust&#146;s Bitcoin Custodian could become insolvent. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust&#146;s assets will be held in one or more accounts maintained for the Trust by the Bitcoin Custodian or at other custodian banks
which may be located in other jurisdictions. The Bitcoin Custodian is not a depository institution as it not insured by the FDIC. The insolvency of the Bitcoin Custodian or of any broker, custodian bank or clearing corporation used by the Bitcoin
Custodian, may result in the loss of all or a substantial portion of the Trust&#146;s assets or in a significant delay in the Trust having access to those assets. Additionally, custody of digital assets presents inherent and unique risks relating to
access loss, theft and means of recourse in such scenarios. These risks are applicable to the Trust&#146;s use of Coinbase Custody. </P>

undivided interest in the bitcoin held by the Trust. The Trust does not generate any income and transfers bitcoin to pay for the Sponsor Fee and other liabilities. Therefore, the amount of bitcoin represented by each Share will gradually decline
over time. This is also true with respect to Shares that are issued in exchange for additional bitcoin over time, as the amount of bitcoin required to create Shares proportionally reflects the amount of bitcoin represented by the Shares outstanding
at the time of such creation unit being created. Assuming a constant bitcoin price, the trading price of the Shares is expected to gradually decline relative to the price of bitcoin as the amount of bitcoin represented by the Shares gradually

human resources than the Sponsor. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be effective competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. The Trust&#146;s competitors may also charge a
substantially lower fee than the Sponsor Fee in order to achieve initial market acceptance and scale. Accordingly, the Sponsor&#146;s competitors may commercialize a competing product more rapidly or effectively than the Sponsor is able to, which
could adversely affect the Sponsor&#146;s competitive position and the likelihood that the Trust will achieve initial market acceptance, and could have a detrimental effect on the scale and sustainability of the Trust and the Sponsor&#146;s ability
to generate meaningful revenues from the Trust. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Trust fails to achieve sufficient scale due to competition, the Sponsor may have
difficulty raising sufficient revenue to cover the costs associated with launching and maintaining the Trust, and such shortfalls could impact the Sponsor&#146;s ability to properly invest in robust ongoing operations and controls of the Trust to
minimize the risk of operating events, errors, or other forms of losses to the Shareholders. In addition, the Trust may also fail to attract adequate liquidity in the secondary market due to such competition, resulting in a sub-standard number of
Authorized Participants willing to make a market in the Shares, which in turn could result in a significant premium or discount in the Shares for extended periods and the Trust&#146;s failure to reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin. </P>

methodology (except calculation time) as the Index Provider&#146;s Bitcoin Reference Rate (&#147;BRR&#148;), which was first introduced in November 2016, the Index itself has only been in operation since February 2022, and the Index has only
featured its current roster of Constituent Exchanges since May 2022. A longer history of actual performance through various economic and market conditions would provide greater and more reliable information for an investor to assess the Index&#146;s

Although many pricing sources refer to themselves as &#147;exchanges,&#148; they are not registered with, or supervised by, the SEC or CFTC and do not meet the regulatory standards of a national securities exchange or designated contract market. For
these reasons, among others, purchases and sales of bitcoin may be subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including the lack of liquidity in the markets and government regulation and intervention. These

asset markets, have resulted in calls for heightened scrutiny and regulation of the digital asset industry, with a specific focus on intermediaries such as digital asset exchanges, platforms, and
custodians. Federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies may introduce and enact new laws and regulations to regulate crypto asset intermediaries, such as digital asset exchanges and custodians. The March 2023 collapses of Silicon Valley
Bank, Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank, which in some cases provided services to the digital assets industry, may amplify and/or accelerate these trends. On January 3, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a joint statement on crypto-asset
risks to banking organizations following events which exposed vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector, including the risk of fraud and scams, legal uncertainties, significant volatility, and contagion risk. Although banking organizations are not

and platforms from &#147;falling between regulatory cracks,&#148; as well as for more resources to protect investors in &#147;this growing and volatile sector.&#148; The chair called for federal legislation centering on digital asset trading,
lending, and decentralized finance (&#147;DeFi&#148;) platforms, seeking &#147;additional plenary authority&#148; to write rules for digital asset trading and lending. It is not possible to predict whether Congress will grant additional authorities

the BSA by acting as a money services business and selling the digital asset without registering with FinCEN, and by failing to implement and maintain an adequate anti-money laundering program. In 2017, FinCEN assessed a $110&nbsp;million fine
against <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">BTC-e,</FONT> a now defunct digital asset exchange, for similar violations. The requirement that exchangers that do business in the U.S. register with FinCEN and comply with anti-money laundering regulations

payment stablecoin issuers. These requirements include capital, liquidity and risk management requirements, application of the BSA and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act&#146;s customer privacy requirements, certain activities limits, and broad supervision

many similarities to the BitLicense and features a multistate reciprocity licensure feature, wherein a business licensed in one state could apply for accelerated licensure procedures in other states. It is still unclear, however, how many states, if

associated with the Bitcoin network to either somehow transfer the bitcoin out of the bitcoin address to which the entity no longer can access the private keys to a new bitcoin address that it currently does control, or alternatively amend the
source code to the Bitcoin network itself to restore its access to the stranded bitcoin. If a court decides to grant the relief requested, wide-ranging and fundamental changes to the source code, operations, and governance of, and basic principles

bitcoin is still undefined or changing. Some countries have deemed the usage of certain digital assets illegal. Other countries have banned digital assets or securities or derivatives in respect to them (including for certain categories of
investors), banned the local banks from working with digital assets or have restricted digital assets in other ways. For example, bitcoin and other digital assets currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions, such
as the European Union, China, the United Kingdom, Australia, Russia, Israel, Poland, India and Canada. In some countries, such as the United States, different government agencies define digital assets differently, leading to further regulatory

bitcoin might be classified by the SEC as a &#147;security&#148; under U.S. federal securities laws. In the face of such developments, the required registrations and compliance steps may result in extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to the Trust.
In particular, the Trust may be required to rapidly unwind its entire position in bitcoin at potentially unfavorable prices and potentially terminate, in the event that bitcoin were determined to fall under the definition of a security under U.S.

the federal securities laws. However, the SEC has commented on bitcoin and bitcoin-related market developments and has taken action against investment schemes involving bitcoin. For example, in a
recent letter regarding the SEC&#146;s review of proposed rule changes to list and trade shares of certain bitcoin-related investment vehicles on public markets, the SEC staff stated that it has significant investor protection concerns regarding the
markets for digital assets, including the potential for market manipulation and fraud. In March 2018, it was reported that the SEC was examining as many as 100 investment funds with strategies focused on digital assets. The reported focus of the
examinations is on the accuracy of risk disclosures to investors in these funds, digital asset pricing practices, and compliance with rules meant to prevent the theft of investor funds, as well as on information gathering so that the SEC can better
understand new technologies and investment products. It has further been reported that some of these funds have received subpoenas from the SEC&#146;s Enforcement Division. The SEC also recently determined that certain digital assets are securities
under the U.S. securities laws. In these determinations, the SEC reasoned that the unregistered offer and sale of digital assets can, in certain circumstances, including ICOs, be considered illegal public offering of securities. A significant amount
of funding for digital asset startups has come from ICOs, and if ICOs are halted or face obstacles, or companies that rely on them face legal action or investigation, it could have a negative impact on the value of digital assets, including bitcoin.
Finally, the SEC&#146;s Division of Examinations (then the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (&#147;OCIE&#148;)) stated that digital assets were an examination priority for 2020. In particular, OCIE intended to focus its examination
on portfolio management of digital assets, safety of client funds and assets, pricing and valuation of client portfolios, compliance and internal controls, and supervision of employee outside business activities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC has recently proposed rule changes amending and redesignating rule 206(4)-2 under the Advisers Act (the &#147;Custody Rule&#148;). The
proposed &#147;Safeguarding Rule&#148; would amend the definition of a &#147;qualified custodian&#148; under the Custody Rule and expand the scope of the Custody Rule to cover all digital assets, including bitcoin, and related advisory activities.
If enacted as proposed, these rule changes would likely impose additional regulatory requirements with respect to the custody and storage of digital assets, including bitcoin. The Sponsor is studying the impact that such amendments may have on the
Trust and its arrangements with the Bitcoin Custodian. It is possible that such amendments, if adopted, could prevent the Bitcoin Custodian from serving as service providers to the Trust, or require potentially significant modifications to existing
arrangements, which could cause the Trust to bear potentially significant increased costs. If the Sponsor is unable to make such modifications or appoint successor service providers to fill the roles that the Bitcoin Custodian currently plays, the
Trust&#146;s operations (including in relation to creations and redemptions of Baskets and the holding of bitcoin) could be negatively affected, the Trust could dissolve (including at a time that is potentially disadvantageous to Shareholders), and
the value of the Shares or an investment in the Trust could be affected. Further, the proposed amendments could have a severe negative impact on the price of bitcoin and therefore the value of the Shares if enacted, by, among other things, making it
more difficult for investors to gain access to bitcoin, or causing certain holders of bitcoin to sell their holdings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If regulatory

Shareholder will include in the computation of their taxable income their proportionate share of the taxable income and expenses of the Trust, including gains and losses realized in connection with the use of bitcoin to pay Trust expenses. The Trust
does not anticipate making distributions to Shareholders, so any tax liability that a Shareholder incurs as a result of holding Shares will need to be satisfied from some other source of funds. If a Shareholder sells Shares in order to raise funds
to satisfy such a tax liability, the sale itself may generate additional taxable gain or loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The tax treatment of bitcoin and

treated as property, not as currency, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and transactions involving payment in bitcoin in return for goods and services are treated as barter exchanges. Such exchanges result in capital gain or loss measured by the
difference between the price at which bitcoin is exchanged and the taxpayer&#146;s basis in the bitcoin. However, because bitcoin is a new technological innovation, because IRS guidance has taken the form of administrative pronouncements that may be
modified without prior notice and comment, and because there is as yet little case law on the subject, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in bitcoin or in transactions relating to investments in bitcoin may change from that
described in this Prospectus, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change in the U.S. federal income tax treatment of bitcoin may have a negative effect on prices of bitcoin and may adversely affect the value of the Shares. In this regard, the
IRS has indicated that it has made it a priority to issue additional guidance related to the taxation of virtual currency transactions, such as transactions involving bitcoin. In addition, the IRS and U.S. Department of Treasury have proposed
regulations regarding the tax information reporting rules for crypto currency transactions. While it has started to issue such additional guidance, whether any future guidance will adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an
investment in bitcoin or in transactions relating to investments in bitcoin is unknown. Moreover, future developments that may arise with respect to digital currencies may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital currencies

state and local income and sales and use taxes, is not settled. It is uncertain what guidance, if any, on the treatment of bitcoin for state and local tax purposes may be issued in the future. A state or local government authority&#146;s treatment
of bitcoin may have negative consequences, including the imposition of a greater tax burden on investors in bitcoin or the imposition of a greater cost on the acquisition and disposition of bitcoin generally. Moreover, it cannot be ruled out that
the tax treatment by tax authorities and courts could be interpreted differently or could be subject to changes in the future. Any such treatment may have a negative effect on prices of bitcoin and may adversely affect the value of the Shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The taxation of bitcoin and associated companies can vary significantly by jurisdiction and is subject to risk of significant revision. Such

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust intends to disclaim any digital assets created by a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. Although in certain circumstances the Sponsor may
claim or receive new digital assets created by such a fork and use good faith efforts to make those digital assets (or at the Sponsor&#146;s discretion, the proceeds thereof) available to Shareholders as of the record date of the fork, there can be
no assurance that the Sponsor will do so. Therefore, if a fork of the Bitcoin network results in holders of bitcoin receiving a new digital asset of value, the Trust and the Shareholders may not participate in that value. </P>

the new &#147;forked&#148; asset. Under current IRS guidance, a hard fork resulting in the receipt of new units of cryptocurrency is a taxable event giving rise to ordinary income equal to the value of the new cryptocurrency. The Trust Agreement
will require that, if such a transaction occurs, the Trust will as soon as possible direct the Bitcoin Custodian to distribute the new forked asset <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-kind</FONT> to the Sponsor, as agent for the Shareholders, and
the Sponsor will arrange to sell the new forked asset and for the proceeds to be distributed to the Shareholders. Such a sale will give rise to gain or loss, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if the amount realized on the sale differs from the
value of the new forked asset at the time it was received by the Trust. A hard fork may therefore give rise to additional tax liabilities for Shareholders. </P>

open-source, and anyone can contribute to its development. The value of bitcoin is in part determined by the supply of, and demand for, bitcoin in the global markets for the trading of bitcoin, market expectations for the adoption of bitcoin as a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bitcoin is an open-source project with no central authority that controls the Bitcoin network, and anyone can review the underlying code and
suggest changes. There are, however, a number of individual developers that regularly contribute to a specific distribution of Bitcoin network software known as the &#147;Bitcoin Core,&#148; and who loosely oversee the development of its source
code. There are many other compatible versions of Bitcoin network software, but Bitcoin Core is the most widely adopted and currently provides the <I>de facto </I>standard for the Bitcoin protocol. The core developers are able to access, and can
alter, the Bitcoin network source code and, as a result, they are responsible for quasi-official releases of updates and other changes to the Bitcoin network&#146;s source code. However, because bitcoin has no central authority, the release of
updates to the Bitcoin network&#146;s source code by the core developers does not guarantee that the updates will be automatically adopted by the other participants in the Bitcoin network. Users and miners must accept any changes made to the Bitcoin
network source code by downloading the proposed modification of the Bitcoin network&#146;s source code. A modification of the Bitcoin network&#146;s source code is effective only with respect to those Bitcoin users and miners who choose to download
it. If a modification is accepted by only a percentage of users and miners, a division in the Bitcoin network will occur such that one network will run the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-modification</FONT> source code and the other network
will run the modified source code. Such a division is known as a &#147;fork.&#148; See &#147;<I>Risk Factors&#151;Risks Associated with bitcoin and the Bitcoin network</I>.&#148; A modification to the source code becomes part of the Bitcoin network
only if accepted by participants collectively having most of the processing power on the Bitcoin network. In recent years, there have been several forks in the Bitcoin network, including, but not limited to, forks resulting in the creation of
Bitcoin Cash (August 1, 2017), Bitcoin Gold (October 24, 2017) and Bitcoin SegWit2X (December 28, 2017), among others. For example, on August&nbsp;1, 2017, a group of developers and miners accepted certain changes to the Bitcoin network software
intended to increase transaction capacity, while the rest of the Bitcoin network did not, causing a hard fork. Blocks mined on this new network, called Bitcoin Cash, now diverge from blocks mined on the Bitcoin network, which has resulted in the
creation of a new blockchain whose digital asset is referred to as &#147;bitcoin cash.&#148; Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash now operate as separate, independent networks, and have different native digital assets (bitcoin versus bitcoin cash). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust has adopted the following procedures to address situations involving a fork that results in the issuance of new cryptocurrency that
the Trust may receive. Typically, the holder of bitcoin has no discretion in a hard fork transaction; it merely receives the new cryptocurrency while it continues to hold the same number of bitcoin. The Trust Agreement will stipulate that if such a
transaction does occur, the Trust will as soon as possible direct the Bitcoin Custodian to distribute the new cryptocurrency <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-kind</FONT> to the Sponsor, as agent for the Shareholders, and the Sponsor will arrange
to sell the new cryptocurrency and for the proceeds to be distributed to the Shareholders. The Trust is under no obligation to claim the forked asset if doing so will expose the Trust&#146;s (original) bitcoin holdings to risk. Alternatively, the
Bitcoin Custodian may not agree to provide the Trust with access to the forked asset. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Core development of the Bitcoin Network source code

Lightning Network was released. The Lightning Network is an open-source decentralized network that enables instant off-Bitcoin blockchain transfers of the ownership of bitcoin without the need of
a trusted third party. The system utilizes bidirectional payment channels that consist of multi-signature addresses. One on-blockchain transaction is needed to open a channel and another on-blockchain transaction can close the channel. Once a
channel is open, value can be transferred instantly between counterparties who are engaging in real bitcoin transactions without broadcasting them to the Bitcoin network. New transactions will replace previous transactions, and the counterparties
will store everything locally as long as the channel stays open to increase transaction throughput and reduce computational burden on the Bitcoin network. Other efforts include increased use of smart contracts and distributed registers built into,
built atop or pegged alongside the Bitcoin blockchain. The Trust&#146;s activities will not directly relate to such projects, though such projects may utilize bitcoin as tokens for the facilitation of their
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-financial</FONT> uses, thereby potentially increasing demand for bitcoin and the utility of the Bitcoin network as a whole. Conversely, projects that operate and are built within the Bitcoin blockchain may
increase the data flow on the Bitcoin network and could either bloat the size of the Bitcoin blockchain or slow confirmation times. At this time, such projects remain in early stages and have not been materially integrated into the Bitcoin
blockchain or the Bitcoin network. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Currently, the Bitcoin network is in the process of considering the implementation of the proposed
Taproot upgrade, a soft fork which is intended to enhance smart contract functionality on the Bitcoin blockchain and make complex transactions (e.g., multi-signature transactions) similar to ordinary transactions in terms of their <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-chain</FONT> footprint. The Taproot upgrade will reduce the size of complex bitcoin transactions and will replace the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-blockchain</FONT> storage of such data with a single
cryptographic hash for the entire transaction, thereby enhancing privacy while also reducing the data size for complex transactions. This is expected to result in making complex transactions cheaper and easier to execute. Following a lengthy debate
among the core developers, the code for the Taproot upgrades was merged into the Bitcoin Core software on a temporary trial basis. A supermajority of miners must signal their approval for the adoption of the Taproot upgrade during a specified time
window, or the Taproot upgrade will not become permanently activated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Bitcoin Transactions </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A bitcoin transaction is similar in concept to an irreversible digital check. The transaction contains the sender&#146;s bitcoin address, the
recipient&#146;s bitcoin address, the amount of bitcoin to be sent, a transaction fee and the sender&#146;s digital signature. The sender&#146;s use of his or her digital signature enables participants on the Bitcoin network to verify the
authenticity of the bitcoin transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A user&#146;s digital signature is generated via usage of the user&#146;s <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">so-called</FONT> &#147;private key,&#148; one of two numbers in a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">so-called</FONT> cryptographic &#147;key pair.&#148; A key pair consists of a &#147;public key&#148; and its corresponding
private key, both of which are lengthy alphanumeric codes, derived together and possessing a unique relationship. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Public keys are
associated with bitcoin addresses that are publicly known and can accept a bitcoin transfer. Private keys are used to sign transactions that initiate the transfer of bitcoin from a sender&#146;s bitcoin address to a recipient&#146;s bitcoin address.
Only the holder of the private key associated with a particular bitcoin address can digitally sign a transaction proposing a transfer of bitcoin from that particular bitcoin address. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A user&#146;s bitcoin address may be safely distributed, but a user&#146;s private key must be kept in accordance with appropriate controls
and procedures to ensure it is used only for legitimate and intended transactions. Only by using a private key can a bitcoin user create a digital signature to transfer bitcoin to another user. In addition, if an unauthorized third person learns of
a user&#146;s private key, that third person could forge the user&#146;s digital signature and send the user&#146;s bitcoin to any arbitrary bitcoin address, thereby stealing the user&#146;s bitcoin. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The usage of key pairs is a cornerstone of the Bitcoin network. This is because the use of a private key is the only mechanism by which a
bitcoin transaction can be signed. If a private key is lost, the corresponding bitcoin is thereafter permanently <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-transferable.</FONT> Moreover, the theft of a private key enables the thief immediate and

unfettered access to the corresponding bitcoin. Bitcoin users must therefore understand that in this regard, bitcoin is a bearer asset, similar to cash: that is, the person or entity in control
of the private key corresponding to a particular quantity of bitcoin has <I>de facto </I>control of the bitcoin. For large quantities of bitcoin, holders often employ sophisticated security measures. For a discussion of how the Trust secures its
bitcoin, see &#147;<I>The Bitcoin Custodian</I>&#148; below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bitcoin network incorporates a system to prevent double spending of a
single bitcoin. To prevent the possibility of double-spending a single bitcoin, each validated transaction is recorded, time stamped and publicly displayed in a &#147;block&#148; in the Bitcoin blockchain, which is publicly available. Thus, the
Bitcoin network provides confirmation against double-spending by memorializing every transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain, which is publicly accessible and downloaded in part or in whole by all users of the Bitcoin network software program. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process by which bitcoin are created and bitcoin transactions are verified is called mining. To begin mining, a user, or
&#147;miner,&#148; can download special mining software, which, like regular Bitcoin network software programs, turns the user&#146;s computer into a &#147;node&#148; on the Bitcoin network. A node may validate transactions and add new blocks of
transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Miners, through the use of the bitcoin software program, engage in a set of prescribed complex
mathematical calculations imposed by the Bitcoin network&#146;s software protocol, called &#147;proof of work,&#148; in order to validate proposed transactions and bundle them into a data packet known as a &#147;block.&#148; The first miner who
successfully solves the cryptographic puzzle imposed by the Bitcoin network&#146;s software protocol is permitted to add a block of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain and is rewarded by a grant of newly-issued bitcoin, known as the &#147;block
reward.&#148; Bitcoin is created and allocated by the Bitcoin network protocol and distributed through a &#147;mining&#148; process subject to a strict, well-known issuance schedule. Block rewards for mining are the method by which new bitcoin is
issued. The supply of bitcoin is limited to 21&nbsp;million by the Bitcoin network&#146;s software protocol. Miners may also be paid an optional transaction fee by the users whose transactions are contained in the mined block. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Confirmed and validated bitcoin transactions are recorded in blocks added to the Bitcoin blockchain. Each block contains the details of some
or all of the most recent transactions that are not memorialized in prior blocks, as well as a record of the award of bitcoin to the miner who added the new block. Each unique block can only be solved and added to the Bitcoin blockchain by one
miner; as a result, individual miners and mining pools on the Bitcoin network engage in a competitive process of constantly increasing their computing power to improve their individual likelihood of solving new blocks. As more miners join the
Bitcoin network and its processing power increases, or if miners leave the Bitcoin network and its processing power declines, the Bitcoin network adjusts the complexity of a block-solving equation to maintain a predetermined pace of adding a new
block to the Bitcoin blockchain approximately every ten minutes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Bitcoin Markets </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bitcoin can be transferred in direct <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">peer-to-peer</FONT></FONT> transactions
through the direct sending of bitcoin over the Bitcoin blockchain from one bitcoin address to another. Among <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-users,</FONT> bitcoin can be used to pay other members of the Bitcoin network for goods and services
under what resembles a barter system. Consumers can also pay merchants and other commercial businesses for goods or services through direct <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">peer-to-peer</FONT></FONT> transactions on
the Bitcoin blockchain or through third-party service providers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to using bitcoin to engage in transactions, investors may
purchase and sell bitcoin to speculate as to the value of bitcoin in the bitcoin market, or as a long-term investment to diversify their portfolio. The value of bitcoin within the market is determined, in part, by the supply of and demand for
bitcoin in the global bitcoin market, market expectations for the adoption of bitcoin as a store of value, the number of merchants that accept bitcoin as a form of payment, and the volume of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bitcoin spot markets typically permit investors to open accounts with the market and then
purchase and sell bitcoin via websites or through mobile applications. Prices for trades on bitcoin spot markets are typically reported publicly. An investor opening a trading account must deposit an accepted government-issued currency into their
account with the spot market, or a previously acquired digital asset, before they can purchase or sell assets on the spot market. The process of establishing an account with a bitcoin market and trading bitcoin is different from, and should not be
confused with, the process of users sending bitcoin from one bitcoin address to another bitcoin address on the Bitcoin blockchain. This latter process is an activity that occurs on the Bitcoin network, while the former is an activity that occurs
entirely within the order book operated by the spot market. The spot market typically records the investor&#146;s ownership of bitcoin in its internal books and records, rather than on the Bitcoin blockchain. The spot market ordinarily does not
transfer bitcoin to the investor on the Bitcoin blockchain unless the investor makes a request to the exchange to withdraw the bitcoin in their exchange account to an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-exchange</FONT> bitcoin wallet. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside of the spot markets, bitcoin can be traded OTC. The OTC market is largely institutional in nature, and OTC market participants
generally consist of institutional entities, such as firms that offer <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-sided</FONT> liquidity for bitcoin, investment managers, proprietary trading firms, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">high-net-worth</FONT></FONT> individuals that trade bitcoin on a proprietary basis, entities with sizeable bitcoin holdings, and family offices. The OTC market provides a relatively flexible market in terms of quotes,
price, quantity, and other factors, although it tends to involve large blocks of bitcoin. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry meeting place. Parties engaging in OTC transactions will agree upon a price&#151;often via phone or
email&#151;and then one of the two parties will then initiate the transaction. For example, a seller of bitcoin could initiate the transaction by sending the bitcoin to the buyer&#146;s bitcoin address. The buyer would then wire U.S. dollars to the
seller&#146;s bank account. OTC trades are sometimes hedged and eventually settled with concomitant trades on bitcoin spot markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
addition, bitcoin futures and options trading occurs on exchanges in the U.S. regulated by the CFTC. The market for CFTC-regulated trading of bitcoin derivatives has developed substantially. As of April&nbsp;29, 2021, CFTC regulated bitcoin futures
represented approximately $66&nbsp;billion in notional trading volume on Chicago Mercantile Exchange (&#147;CME&#148;). Bitcoin futures on the CME traded over $1.2&nbsp;billion per day in December 2020 and represented $1.6&nbsp;billion in open
interest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although bitcoin was the first digital asset, in the ensuing years, the number of digital assets, market participants and
companies in the space has increased dramatically. In addition to bitcoin, other well-known digital assets include ether, XRP, bitcoin cash, and litecoin. As of April&nbsp;29, 2021, bitcoin had a total market capitalization of approximately
$994&nbsp;billion and represented approximately 48.2% of the entire digital asset market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed in more detail below, barring the
liquidation of the Trust or extraordinary circumstances, the Trust will not directly purchase or sell bitcoin, although the Trustee may direct the Bitcoin Custodian to sell bitcoin to pay certain expenses. Instead, Authorized Participants will
deliver bitcoin to the Trust&#146;s account with the Bitcoin Custodian in exchange for Shares of the Trust, and the Trust, through the Bitcoin Custodian, will deliver bitcoin to Authorized Participants when those Authorized Participants redeem
Shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Regulation of Bitcoin and Government Oversight </B></P>

countries have issued rules or guidance about the treatment of digital asset transactions or requirements for businesses engaged in digital asset activity. As noted previously, the SEC has not asserted regulatory authority over bitcoin or trading or

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The CFTC has regulatory jurisdiction over the bitcoin futures markets. In addition, because the CFTC has determined that bitcoin is a
&#147;commodity&#148; under the CEA and the rules thereunder, it has jurisdiction to prosecute fraud and manipulation in the cash, or spot, market for bitcoin. The CFTC has pursued enforcement actions relating to fraud and manipulation involving
bitcoin and bitcoin markets. Beyond instances of fraud or manipulation, the CFTC generally does not oversee cash or spot market exchanges or transactions involving bitcoin that do not use collateral, leverage, or financing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;1, 2017, two designated contract markets (&#147;DCMs&#148;) registered with the CFTC self-certified new contracts for bitcoin

basis, with twenty-three Core Principles established in Section&nbsp;5(d) of the CEA. Among other things, DCMs are required to establish self-regulatory programs designed to enforce the DCM&#146;s rules, prevent market manipulation and customer and
market abuses, and ensure the recording and safe storage of trade information. The CFTC engaged in a &#147;heightened review&#148; of the self-certification of bitcoin futures, which required DCMs to enter direct information sharing agreements with
spot market platforms to allow access to trade and trader data; monitor data from cash markets with respect to price settlements and other bitcoin prices more broadly, and identify anomalies and disproportionate moves in the cash markets compared to
the futures markets; engage in inquiries, including at the trade settlement level when necessary; and agree to regular coordination with CFTC surveillance staff on trade activities, including providing the CFTC surveillance team with trade
settlement data upon request. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Various foreign jurisdictions have, and may continue to, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or

is calculated daily and aggregates the notional value of bitcoin trading activity across major bitcoin spot exchanges. The Index currently uses substantially the same methodology as the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (&#147;BRR&#148;), including
utilizing the same constituent Bitcoin Exchanges, which is the underlying rate to determine settlement of CME bitcoin futures contracts, except that the Index is calculated as of 4:00 p.m. ET, whereas the BRR is calculated as of 4:00 p.m. London
time. The Index is designed based on the IOSCO Principals for Financial Benchmarks. The Index Provider is the administrator of the Index. The Trust also uses the Index to calculate its NAV, which is the aggregate U.S. Dollar value of bitcoin in the
Trust, based on the Index, less its liabilities and expenses. &#147;NAV per Share&#148; is calculated by dividing NAV by the number of Shares currently outstanding. NAV and NAV per Share are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. NAV is

believes that the use of the Index is reflective of a reasonable valuation of the average spot price of bitcoin and that resistance to manipulation is a priority aim of its design methodology. The methodology: (i) takes an observation period and
divides it into equal partitions of time; (ii) then calculates the volume-weighted median of all transactions within each partition; and (iii) the value is determined from the arithmetic mean of the volume-weighted medians, equally weighted. By
employing the foregoing steps, the Index thereby seeks to ensure that transactions in bitcoin conducted at outlying prices do not have an undue effect on the value of a specific partition, large trades or clusters of trades transacted over a short
period of time will not have an undue influence on the index level, and the effect of large trades at prices that deviate from the prevailing price are mitigated from having an undue influence on the benchmark level. </P>

a market approach, determined on a daily basis in accordance with the Index price at 4:00 p.m. ET. The Sponsor believes that use of the Index mitigates against idiosyncratic market risk, as the failure of any individual spot market will not

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Administrator calculates the NAV of the Trust once each Exchange trading day. The NAV for a normal trading day will be released after 4:00
p.m. ET. Trading during the core trading session on the Exchange typically closes at 4:00 p.m. ET. However, NAVs are not officially struck until later in the day (often by 5:30 p.m. ET and almost always by 8:00 p.m. EST). The pause between 4:00 p.m.
ET and 5:30 p.m. ET (or later) provides an opportunity for the Administrator to algorithmically detect, flag, investigate, and correct unusual pricing should it occur. Any such correction could adversely affect the value of the Shares. In addition,
in order to provide updated information relating to the Trust for use by Shareholders and market professionals, Solactive will calculate and disseminate throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated intraday indicative value
(&#147;IIV&#148;). The IIV will be calculated by using the prior day&#146;s closing NAV as a base and updating that value during the trading day based off of more recent bitcoin pricing information to reflect any changes in the value of the
Trust&#146;s underlying assets and, therefore, the Trust&#146;s NAV. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The IIV disseminated during the Exchange core trading session hours
should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the NAV, because NAV per Share is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of the Trust&#146;s investments. The IIV will be disseminated on a
per Share basis every 15 seconds during regular Exchange core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m. ET to 4:00 p.m. ET. Solactive will disseminate the IIV value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines. In addition, the IIV will be available
through <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-line</FONT> information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters. The IIV may differ from the NAV due to the differences in the time window of trades used to calculate each price (the NAV uses a sixty-minute
window, whereas the IIV draws prices from the last trade on each exchange in an effort to produce a relevant, real-time price). The Sponsor does not believe this will cause confusion in the marketplace, as Authorized Participants are the only
Shareholders who interact with the NAV and the Sponsor will communicate its NAV calculation methodology clearly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dissemination of the IIV
provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to Shareholders and market professionals in connection with the trading of the Trust&#146;s Shares on the Exchange. Shareholders and market professionals
will be able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of the Trust and the IIV. If the market price of the Trust&#146;s Shares diverges significantly from the IIV, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage
trades. For example, if the Trust appears to be trading at a discount compared to the IIV, a market professional could buy the Trust&#146;s Shares on the Exchange and sell short futures contracts. Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking
between the market price of the Trust and the IIV and thus can be beneficial to all market participants. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust does not expect that price differentials for bitcoin across exchanges would have a
meaningful impact on this arbitrage mechanism. Furthermore, the Trust does not expect that the closure of any single one exchange would meaningfully impact the arbitrage mechanism because Authorized Participants typically source underlying spot
bitcoin liquidity from multiple exchanges. The Trust acknowledges, however, that this arbitrage mechanism could potentially be adversely impacted if halts in the trading of spot bitcoin were to occur across multiple exchanges, whether due to
breaches or otherwise. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor reserves the right to adjust the Share price of the Trust in the future to maintain convenient trading
ranges for Shareholders. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits. Such splits would decrease (in the case of a split) or increase (in the case of a reverse split) the proportionate NAV per Share but would
have no effect on the net assets of the Trust or the proportionate voting rights of Shareholders or the value of any Shareholder&#146;s investment. </P>

Market NAV and Principal Market NAV per Share on each valuation date for such financial statements. The determination of the Principal Market NAV and Principal Market NAV per Share is identical to the calculation of NAV and NAV per Share,
respectively, except that the value of bitcoin is determined using the fair value of bitcoin based on the price in the bitcoin market that the Trust considers its &#147;principal market&#148; as of 4:00 p.m. ET on the valuation date, rather than
using the Index. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust has adopted a valuation policy, which provides for the procedure for valuing the Trust&#146;s assets. The
policy also sets forth the procedures to determine the principal market (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of determining the Principal Market NAV and Principal Market NAV per Share in accordance
with FASB ASC 820-10, which outlines the application of fair value accounting. Under its valuation policy, the Trust determines its principal market (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a
analysis at least on a quarterly basis to determine whether there have occurred any changes in bitcoin markets and its operations that would require a change in the Trust&#146;s determination of its principal market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust identifies and determines the bitcoin principal market (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for
GAAP purposes consistent with the application of fair value measurement framework in FASB ASC 820-10. This analysis is performed from the perspective of both the Trust and the Bitcoin Counterparty. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for Bitcoin in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Trust to assume that bitcoin is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market
participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under ASC 820-10, a principal market is the market with the greatest volume and activity level for the asset or liability. The determination

Trust reviews a list of Digital Asset Markets and scopes in the markets that the Trust reasonably believes are operating in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and those that are accessible to the Trust and the Authorized Participant.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Second, the Trust sorts the remaining Digital Asset Markets from high to low based on volume and level of activity of bitcoin traded on
each Digital Asset Market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third, the Trust then reviews intra-day pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital
Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fourth, the Trust then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market based on the highest market-based volume, level of activity, and
price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Trust, Exchange Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. The Trust therefore looks to
accessible Exchange Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of the analysis, the Trust will select an Exchange Market as the Trust&#146;s principal market. Based on the Trust&#146;s initial
assessment, the NAV and NAV per Share will be calculated using the fair value of bitcoin based on the price provided by this Exchange, as of 4:00 p.m., ET on the measurement date for GAAP purposes. The Trust anticipates that this Exchange will be
normally transacted on by both the Trust and the Bitcoin Counterparty. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust will update its Principal Market analysis periodically
and as needed to the extent that events have occurred, or activities have changed in a manner that could change the Trust&#146;s determination of the principal market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor on behalf of the Trust will determine in its sole discretion the valuation sources and policies used to prepare the Trust&#146;s

other than which is maintained in the Trading Balance with the Prime Broker, in the Vault Balance. The Bitcoin Custodian will keep a substantial portion of the private keys associated with the Trust&#146;s bitcoin in &#147;cold storage&#148; or
similarly secure technology. Cold storage is a safeguarding method with multiple layers of protections and protocols, by which the private key(s) corresponding to the Trust&#146;s bitcoin is (are) generated and stored in an offline manner. Private
keys are generated in offline computers that are not connected to the internet so that they are resistant to being hacked. By contrast, in hot storage, the private keys are held online, where they are more accessible, leading to more efficient
transfers, though they are potentially more vulnerable to being hacked. While the Bitcoin Custodian will generally keep a substantial portion of the Trust&#146;s bitcoin in cold storage on an ongoing basis, it is possible that, from time to time,
portions of the Trust&#146;s bitcoin will be held outside of cold storage temporarily in the Trading Balance maintained by the Prime Broker as part of trade facilitation in connection with creations and redemptions of Baskets, to sell bitcoin
including to pay Trust expenses, or to pay the Sponsor Fee, as necessary. The Trust&#146;s bitcoin held in the Cold Vault Balance by the Bitcoin Custodian are held in segregated wallets and therefore are not commingled with the Bitcoin

of bitcoin but may not send bitcoin without use of the corresponding private keys. In order to send bitcoin when the private keys are kept in cold storage, unsigned transactions must be physically transferred to the offline cold storage facility and
signed using a software/hardware utility with the corresponding offline keys. At that point, the Bitcoin Custodian can upload the fully signed transaction to an online network and transfer the bitcoin. Such private keys are stored in cold storage
facilities within the United States and Europe, exact locations of which are not disclosed for security reasons. A limited number of employees at the Bitcoin Custodian are involved in private key management operations, and the Bitcoin Custodian has

associated with the creation to be transferred by the Cash Custodian to the Bitcoin Counterparty prior to purchasing the bitcoin or for the bitcoin held in the Vault Balance to be transferred to a Trading Balance prior to selling the bitcoin. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with a purchase order, the Trust may first borrow cash from the Lender using the Trade Financing Agreement, and then purchase
bitcoin. In connection with a redemption order, the Trust may first borrow bitcoin from the Lender using the Trade Financing Agreement, and then sell this bitcoin. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor does not generally intend to fund the Trading Balance at the Prime Broker with sufficient cash or bitcoin in connection with
creation and redemption transactions or to pay fees and expenses, and instead the Sponsor regularly expects to utilize the Post-Trade Financing Agreement in connection with such creation and redemption transactions or for such fees and expenses. The
purpose of borrowing the bitcoin or cash used in connection with cash creation and redemption or to pay these fees and expenses from the Lender is to lock in the bitcoin price on the trade date or the payment date, as applicable, rather than waiting
for the funds associated with the creation to be transferred by the Cash Custodian to the Bitcoin Counterparty prior to purchasing the bitcoin or for the bitcoin held in the Vault Balance to be transferred to a Trading Balance prior to selling the
bitcoin (a process which may take up to twenty four hours, or longer if the Bitcoin blockchain is experiencing delays in transaction confirmation, or if there are other delays). In the event Trade Credits are unavailable from the Lender or become
exhausted, the Sponsor would require the Authorized Participant to deliver cash on the trade date so that a purchase order can be settled in a timely manner. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because the Trust&#146;s Trading Balance may not be funded with cash on trade date for the purchase of bitcoin associated with the purchase
order, the Trust may borrow Trade Credits in the form of cash from the Lender pursuant to the Post-Trade Financing Agreement or may require the Authorized Participant to deliver the required cash for the purchase order on trade date. The extension
of Trade Credits on trade date allows the Trust to purchase bitcoin through the Bitcoin Counterparty on trade date, with such bitcoin being deposited in the Trust&#146;s Trading Balance. For settlement of a redemption, the Trust delivers Shares to
the Authorized Participant in exchange for cash received from the Authorized Participant. To the extent Trade Credits were utilized, the Trust uses the cash to repay the Trade Credits borrowed from the Lender. Any financing fee owed to the Lender is
deemed part of trade execution costs and embedded in the trade price for each transaction, and therefore is the cash-denominated responsibility of the Authorized Participants. To the extent this position changes and financing fees owed to the Lender
would be a responsibility of the Trust, such expenses could impact the net assets of the Trust over time by increasing the operational expenses of the Trust. </P>

&#147;Available Balance&#148;). The &#147;Authorized Amount&#148; will be an amount to be determined, on a daily basis, based on the Lender&#146;s sole discretion considering factors including, but not limited to, availability of financing and
credit due diligence of the Trust. The Lender is only required to extend Trade Credits to the Trust to the extent such bitcoin or cash is actually available to the Lender. For example, if the Lender is unable to itself borrow bitcoin to lend to the
Trust as a Trade Credit, or there is a material market disruption (as determined by the Lender in good faith and in its sole discretion), the Lender is not obligated to extend Trade Credits to the Trust. The Lender is under no obligation to continue
to provide Trade Credits for certain specific fiat currencies and/or digital assets, and Lender may impose black-out periods during which Trade Credits for currencies or digital assets may be unavailable. </P>

render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any purchaser who purchases Shares with a view towards distribution of such Shares may be deemed to be a statutory underwriter.
In addition, an Authorized Participant, other broker-dealer firm or its client will be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases a basket from the Trust, breaks the basket down into the constituent Shares and sells the Shares to its customers;
or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new Shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for the Shares. In contrast, Authorized Participants may engage in secondary market or other
transactions in Shares that would not be deemed &#147;underwriting.&#148; For example, an Authorized Participant may act in the capacity of a broker or dealer with respect to Shares that were previously distributed by other Authorized Participants.
A determination of whether a particular market participant is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the examples mentioned
above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that would lead to designation as an underwriter and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. </P>

which the Exchange is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the Exchange is suspended or restricted, (2)&nbsp;for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of
bitcoin is not reasonably practicable, or (3)&nbsp;for such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of the Shareholders. For example, the Sponsor may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow
for the orderly liquidation of the Trust&#146;s assets. If the Sponsor has difficulty liquidating the Trust&#146;s positions, e.g., because of a market disruption event or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an
over-the-counter contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified. None of the Sponsor, the person authorized to take redemption orders in the manner provided in the Authorized Participant
Agreement, or the Bitcoin Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Redemption orders must be made in whole Baskets. The Sponsor acting by itself or through the person authorized to take redemption orders in
the manner provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement may, in its sole discretion, reject any redemption order (1)&nbsp;the Sponsor determines not to be in proper form, (2)&nbsp;the fulfillment of which its counsel advises may be illegal under
applicable laws and regulations, or (3)&nbsp;if circumstances outside the control of the Sponsor, the person authorized to take redemption orders in the manner provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement or the Bitcoin Custodian make it for all
practical purposes not feasible for the Shares to be delivered under the redemption order. The Sponsor may also reject a redemption order if the number of Shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding Shares to 5,000 Shares (i.e., 1
Basket) or less. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Marketing Agent shall notify the Authorized Participant of a rejection or suspension of any redemption order. The
Marketing Agent is under no duty, however, to give notification of any specific defects or irregularities nor shall the Marketing Agent or the Trust incur any liability for the failure to give any such notification. The Trust and the Marketing Agent
may not revoke a previously accepted redemption order. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Potential In-Kind Creation and Redemption of Shares </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the future, the Trust may also permit Authorized Participants (or third parties for which the Authorized Participant is acting on behalf) to
create and redeem Shares via in-kind transactions, subject to receiving regulatory approval. The timing of applicable regulatory approval is unknown and there is no guarantee that such regulatory approval will be received. Accordingly, there can be
no assurance that Authorized Participants (or third parties for which the Authorized Participant is acting on behalf) would be permitted to create or redeem Shares via in-kind transactions with the Trust in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To compensate the Transfer Agent for expenses incurred in connection with the creation and redemption of Baskets, an Authorized Participant is
required to pay a transaction fee to the Transfer Agent to create or redeem Baskets, which does not vary in accordance with number of Baskets in such order. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by the Sponsor. The
Sponsor will notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the date of notice. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Tax Responsibility </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Authorized
Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of Baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge
is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify the Sponsor and the Trust if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As noted, the Trust will create and redeem Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets
are only made in exchange for delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of cash equivalent to the amount of bitcoin represented by the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed, as determined on
the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed above, Authorized Participants are the only persons that
may place orders to create and redeem Baskets. Authorized Participants must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, which are not required to register as broker-dealers to
engage in securities transactions. An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to create or redeem Baskets, and an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public Shares of any Baskets it does create. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Authorized Participants that do offer to the public Shares from the Baskets they create will do so at
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">per-Share</FONT> offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the Shares on the Exchange, the NAV of the Trust at the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Baskets,
the NAV of the Shares at the time of the offer of the Shares to the public, the supply of and demand for Shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of bitcoin or other portfolio investments. Baskets are generally redeemed when the price per Share
is at a discount to the NAV per Share. Shares initially comprising the same Basket but offered by Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices. An order for one or more Baskets may be placed by an
Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. Authorized Participants who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets receive no fees, commissions or other forms of compensation or inducement of any kind from the Trust, the Sponsor
or the Sub-Adviser and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor, the Sub-Adviser or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of Shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Shares are expected to trade in the secondary market on the Exchange. Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or
higher relative to their NAV per Share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by various factors, including the number of Shareholders who seek to purchase or sell Shares in the
secondary market and the liquidity of bitcoin. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B><A NAME="rom549524_14"></A>USE OF PROCEEDS </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Proceeds received by the Trust from the issuance of Baskets consist of bitcoin. Such deposits are held by the Bitcoin Custodian on behalf of
the Trust until (i)&nbsp;delivered out in connection with redemptions of Baskets or (ii)&nbsp;transferred or sold by the Bitcoin Custodian to pay fees due to the Sponsor and Trust expenses and liabilities not assumed by the Sponsor. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The beneficial interest in the Trust is divided into Shares. Each Share of the Trust represents an equal beneficial interest in the net assets
of the Trust, and each holder of Shares is entitled to receive such holder&#146;s pro rata share of distributions of income and capital gains, if any. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All Shares are fully paid and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-assessable.</FONT> No Share will have any priority or preference over any

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are present and potential future conflicts of interest inherent in the Trust&#146;s structure and operation you should consider before
you purchase Shares. The Sponsor will use this notice of conflicts as a defense against any claim or other proceeding made. If the Sponsor is not able to resolve these conflicts of interest adequately, it may impact the Trust&#146;s ability to
achieve its investment objective. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The officers, directors and employees of the Sponsor do not devote their time exclusively to the Trust.
These persons are directors, officers or employees of other entities which may compete with the Trust for their services. They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to the Trust and to those other entities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor and the Sub-Adviser have the authority to manage the investments and operations of the Trust, and this may allow them to act in a
way that furthers their own interests which may create a conflict with shareholders&#146; best interests. Shareholders have very limited voting rights, which limits their ability to influence matters such as amendment of the Trust Agreement, change
in the Trust&#146;s basic investment policy, dissolution of the Trust, or the sale or distribution of the Trust&#146;s assets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Sponsor serves as the sponsor to the Trust. The Sponsor may have a conflict to the extent that its trading decisions for the Trust may be influenced by the effect they would have on other funds its affiliates may manage. In addition, the Sponsor may
be required to indemnify its officers, directors and key employees with respect to their activities on behalf of other funds, if the need for indemnification arises. This potential indemnification could cause the Sponsor&#146;s assets to decrease.
If the Sponsor&#146;s other sources of income are not sufficient to compensate for the indemnification, it could cease operations, which could in turn result in Trust losses and/or termination of the Trust. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor has an affiliate, 21Shares AG, that issues various exchange traded products providing exposure to certain digital assets in
non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, the Sponsor&#146;s affiliate(s) may take management fees in-kind in bitcoin, and as such, may engage in trading of the underlying asset across affiliates. The Sponsor has adopted and implemented policies and
procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable law, including a Code of Ethics providing guidance on conflicts of interest (collectively, the &#147;Policies&#148;). As of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement,
the Sponsor&#146;s Policies are in place and require that the Sponsor eliminate, mitigate, or otherwise disclose conflicts of interest. Additionally, the Sponsor has adopted policies and procedures requiring that certain applicable personnel
pre-clear personal trading activity in which bitcoin is the referenced asset. The Sponsor has also implemented an Information Barrier Policy restricting certain applicable personnel from obtaining sensitive information. The Sponsor believes that
these controls are reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of conflicts of interest and other impermissible activity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, the
Sponsor, the Sub-Adviser or their affiliates may participate in transactions related to bitcoin, either for their own account or for account of a client. Such transactions may not serve to benefit the shareholders of the Trust and may have a
positive or negative effect on the value of the bitcoin held by the Trust and, consequently, on the market value of bitcoin. In addition, the Sponsor, the Sub-Adviser or their affiliates may act in other capacities with regard to other investment
products offered by either party. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor, the Sub-Adviser, or their affiliates may issue derivative instruments relating to bitcoin.
The Sponsor&#146;s affiliate offers investment products that offer short exposure to bitcoin as well as other products that offer long exposure to bitcoin, either of which may take market share from the Trust or affect the value of bitcoin or an
investment in the Trust. Introduction of such competing products may affect the market value of bitcoin and an investment in the Trust. The Sponsor and its affiliated companies may also receive <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-public</FONT>
information relating to bitcoin and neither the Sponsor nor any of its affiliates will undertake to make this information available to investors in the Trust. </P>

the marketplace. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Records of trading by these parties will not be available for inspection by shareholders. Because these parties may

if Sponsor pursues such opportunity or directs it to another person or does not communicate such opportunity to the Trust. Neither the Trust nor any Shareholder will have any rights or obligations by virtue of the Trust Agreement, the trust

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following discussion describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences associated with the purchase, ownership and disposition
of Shares by a U.S. Shareholder (as defined below), and certain U.S. federal income consequences that may apply to an investment in Shares by a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-U.S.</FONT> Shareholder (as defined below). The discussion
represents, insofar as it describes conclusions as to U.S. federal income tax law and subject to the limitations and qualifications described below, the opinion of Dechert LLP. The opinion of Dechert LLP, however, is not binding on the United States
Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) or on the courts and does not preclude the IRS from taking a contrary position. The discussion below is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the date of this Prospectus and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of Shareholders may
vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Except where noted, this discussion only deals with Shares held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment), and does not address special situations, including those of banks,
financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, dealers in securities, currencies, or commodities, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-exempt</FONT> organizations, <FONT

transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons whose &#147;functional currency&#148; is not the U.S. dollar, persons required for U.S. federal income tax purposes to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to
the Shares as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement, or persons subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Moreover, the discussion below does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law
consequences that may apply to an investment in Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisers with respect to all federal, state, local and foreign tax law considerations potentially applicable to their investment in
Shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For purposes of this discussion, a &#147;U.S. Shareholder&#148; is a Shareholder that is: </P>

Shareholders and the IRS on that basis. There can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the conclusions herein and it is possible that the IRS or another tax authority could assert a position contrary to one or all of those conclusions and
that a court could sustain that contrary position. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee will request a ruling from the IRS with respect to the classification of the Trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes or with respect to any other matter. If
the IRS were to assert successfully that the Trust is not classified as a &#147;grantor trust,&#148; the Trust would likely be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which may affect the timing and other tax consequences
to the Shareholders. Under such circumstances, the Trust might be classified as a publicly traded partnership that would be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case the Trust would be taxed in the same manner as a
corporation on its taxable income and distributions to Shareholders out of the earnings and profits of the Trust would be taxed to Shareholders as ordinary dividend income. However, due to the uncertain treatment of digital currency for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, there can be no assurance in this regard. Except as otherwise indicated, the remainder of this discussion assumes that the Trust is classified as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </P>

Shareholder will be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as if it directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets held in the Trust. A Shareholder also will be treated as if it directly received its respective pro rata share of
the Trust&#146;s income, if any, and as if it directly incurred its respective pro rata share of the Trust&#146;s expenses. In the case of a Shareholder that acquires Shares as part of the creation of a Basket, the delivery of bitcoin to the Trust
in exchange for a pro rata share of the underlying bitcoin represented by the Shares will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder, and the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis and holding period for the Shareholder&#146;s pro rata share of the bitcoin
held in the Trust will be the same as its tax basis and holding period for the bitcoin delivered in exchange therefor. For purposes of this discussion, and unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that all of a Shareholder&#146;s Shares are acquired
on the same date and at the same price per Share. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares, should consult their own tax advisers as to the determination of the tax basis and holding
period for the underlying bitcoin related to such Shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Current IRS guidance on the treatment of convertible virtual currencies
classifies bitcoin as &#147;property&#148; that is not currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes and clarifies that bitcoin can be held as a capital asset, but it does not address several other aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of
bitcoin. Because bitcoin is a new technological innovation, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of bitcoin or transactions relating to investments in bitcoin may evolve and change from that discussed below, possibly with retroactive effect. In
this regard, the IRS has indicated that it has made it a priority to issue additional guidance related to the taxation of virtual currency transactions, such as transactions involving bitcoin. In addition, the IRS and U.S. Department of Treasury
have proposed regulations regarding the tax information reporting rules for crypto currency transactions. While it has started to issue such additional guidance, whether any future guidance will adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax treatment
of an investment in bitcoin or in transactions relating to investments in bitcoin is unknown. Moreover, future developments that may arise with respect to digital currencies may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital
currencies for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust will use bitcoin to pay certain expenses of the Trust, which under current IRS
guidance will be treated as a sale of such bitcoin. Although the Trust generally does not intend to sell bitcoin, it may do so in connection with cash redemption transactions, or if necessary to pay certain expenses that must be paid in cash. If the
Trust sells bitcoin (for example to generate cash to pay fees and expenses) or is treated as selling bitcoin (for example, by using bitcoin to pay fees or expenses), a Shareholder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference
between (a)&nbsp;the Shareholder&#146;s pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon the sale and (b)&nbsp;the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for its pro rata share of the bitcoin that was sold. A Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for its share
of any bitcoin sold by the Trust will generally be a pro rata portion of the Shareholder&#146;s total tax basis for its share of all of the bitcoin held in the Trust. After any such sale, a Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for its pro rata

share of the bitcoin remaining in the Trust should be equal to its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the bitcoin held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale less the portion of
such basis allocable to its share of the bitcoin that was sold or treated as sold. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon a Shareholder&#146;s sale of some or all of its
Shares (other than a redemption), the Shareholder will be treated as having sold the pro rata share of the bitcoin held in the Trust at the time of the sale that is attributable to the Shares sold. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will
recognize gain or loss on the sale in an amount equal to the difference between (a)&nbsp;the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares, and (b)&nbsp;the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for the pro rata share of the bitcoin held in the Trust at
the time of sale that is attributable to the Shares sold, as determined in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. Based on current IRS guidance, such gain or loss (as well as any gain or loss realized by a Shareholder on account of the
Trust selling bitcoin) will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the Shareholder has a holding period of greater than one year in its pro rata share of the bitcoin that was sold and otherwise will be short-term capital gain or loss. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Such sales of bitcoin to fund cash redemptions are expected to result in gains and losses with such gains and losses expected to be treated as
incurred by the Shareholder that is being redeemed. These gains or losses generally would equal the difference between the amount realized from the sale of the bitcoin and the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for the portion of the Shareholder&#146;s
pro rata share of the bitcoin held in the Trust that is sold to fund the redemption, as determined in the manner described above. A redemption of some or all of a Shareholder&#146;s Shares in exchange for the cash received from such sale is not
expected to be treated as a separate taxable event for the Shareholder. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A redemption of some or all of a Shareholder&#146;s Shares in
exchange for the underlying bitcoin represented by the Shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. The Shareholder&#146;s tax basis and holding period for the bitcoin received in the redemption generally will be the
same as the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis and holding period for the pro rata share of the bitcoin held in the Trust immediately prior to the redemption that is attributable to the Shares redeemed. A Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for bitcoin received
in a redemption generally will be the same as the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for the portion of the Shareholder&#146;s pro rata share of the bitcoin held in the Trust immediately prior to the redemption that is attributable to the Shares redeemed.
The Shareholder&#146;s holding period for the bitcoin received generally will include the period during which the Shareholder held the Shares being redeemed. A subsequent sale of the bitcoin received the Shareholder generally will be a taxable
event. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After any sale or redemption of less than all of a Shareholder&#146;s Shares, the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for its pro rata
share of the bitcoin held in the Trust immediately after such sale or redemption generally will be equal to its tax basis in its share of the total amount of the bitcoin held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale or redemption, less the portion
of such basis which is taken into account in determining the amount of gain or loss recognized by the Shareholder upon such sale or, in the case of a redemption, that is treated as the basis of the bitcoin received by the Shareholder in the
redemption. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust intends to disclaim any digital assets created by a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. Although in certain
circumstances the Sponsor may claim or receive new digital assets created by such a fork and use good faith efforts to make those digital assets (or at the Sponsor&#146;s discretion, the proceeds thereof) available to Shareholders as of the record
date of the fork, there can be no assurance that the Sponsor will do so. Therefore, if a fork of the Bitcoin network results in holders of bitcoin receiving a new digital asset of value, the Trust and the Shareholders may not participate in that
value. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a hard fork occurs in the Bitcoin blockchain and the Trust claims the new forked asset, the Trust could hold both the original
bitcoin and the new &#147;forked&#148; asset. Under current IRS guidance, a hard fork resulting in the receipt of new units of cryptocurrency is a taxable event giving rise to ordinary income equal to the value of the new cryptocurrency. The Trust

for the Shareholders, and the Sponsor will arrange to sell the new forked asset and for the proceeds to be distributed to the Shareholders. Such a sale will give rise to gain or loss, for U.S.

income over a threshold amount ($250,000 for married persons filing jointly and $200,000 for single taxpayers) or their &#147;net investment income,&#148; which generally includes capital gains from the disposition of property. This tax is in
addition to any capital gains taxes due on such investment income. A similar tax applies to estates and trusts. U.S. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, this tax may have on their investment in the

basis in the underlying assets of the Trust. Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a Shareholder in selling Shares will reduce the amount realized by the Shareholder with respect to the sale. </P>

above), even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata shares of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly
incurred the expense. However, most trust expenses are expected to result in miscellaneous itemized deductions, and noncorporate taxpayers generally are not allowed any deduction with respect to miscellaneous itemized deductions for tax years
beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017, and before January&nbsp;1, 2026. For tax years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2025, noncorporate taxpayers may deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent they exceed in the
