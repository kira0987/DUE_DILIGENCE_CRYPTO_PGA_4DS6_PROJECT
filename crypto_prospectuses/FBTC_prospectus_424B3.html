<P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (the &#147;Trust&#148;) is an exchange-traded product that issues shares of beneficial interest (the
&#147;Shares&#148;) that trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the &#147;Exchange&#148;). The Trust&#146;s investment objective is to seek to track the performance of bitcoin, as measured by the performance of the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate
(the &#147;Index&#148;), adjusted for the Trust&#146;s expenses and other liabilities. The Index is constructed using bitcoin price feeds from eligible bitcoin spot markets and a volume-weighted median price (&#147;VWMP&#148;) methodology,
calculated every 15 seconds based on VWMP spot market data over rolling sixty-minute increments. The Index is designed to reflect the performance of bitcoin in U.S. dollars. In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust holds bitcoin and
values its Shares daily based on the same methodology used to calculate the Index. FD Funds Management LLC (the &#147;Sponsor&#148;) is the sponsor of the Trust, Delaware Trust Company (the &#147;Trustee&#148;) is the trustee of the Trust, State
Street Bank and Trust Company (&#147;State Street&#148; or the &#147;Transfer Agent&#148;) is the Trust&#146;s transfer agent (in such capacity, the &#147;Transfer Agent&#148;) and cash custodian (in such capacity, the &#147;Cash Custodian&#148;),
and Fidelity Digital Asset Services, LLC (&#147;FDAS&#148; or the &#147;Custodian&#148;) is the custodian for the Trust, and holds all of the Trust&#146;s bitcoin on the Trust&#146;s behalf. Jane Street Capital, LLC is the Trust&#146;s initial
Authorized Participant and was a statutory underwriter with respect to the initial purchase of Baskets (as defined below). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust is an
exchange-traded product. When the Trust sells or redeems its Shares, it will do so in blocks of 25,000 Shares (a &#147;Basket&#148;) based on the quantity of bitcoin attributable to each Share of the Trust (net of accrued but unpaid expenses and
liabilities). For a subscription for Shares, the subscription shall be in the amount of cash needed to purchase the amount of bitcoin represented by the Basket being created, as calculated by the Administrator (as defined below). For a redemption of
Shares, the Sponsor shall arrange for the bitcoin represented by the Basket to be sold and the cash proceeds distributed. Financial firms that are authorized to purchase or redeem Shares with the Trust (known as &#147;Authorized Participants&#148;)
will deliver, or facilitate the delivery of, cash to the Trust&#146;s account with the Cash Custodian in exchange for Shares when they purchase Shares, and the Trust will deliver cash to such Authorized Participants when they redeem Shares with the
Trust. Shares initially comprising the same Basket but offered by the Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices, which depend on various factors, including the supply and demand for Shares, the value
of the Trust&#146;s assets, and market conditions at the time of a transaction. The initial price per Share is $40 and was selected as an appropriate and convenient price that would facilitate secondary market trading of Shares. Owners of the
beneficial interests of Shares (&#147;Shareholders&#148;) who buy or sell Shares during the day from their broker on the secondary market may do so at a premium or discount relative to the per Share net asset value of the Trust. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Shareholders who decide to buy or sell Shares of the Trust will place their trade orders through their brokers and will incur customary
brokerage commissions and charges. The Shares are listed for trading on the Exchange under the ticker symbol &#147;FBTC&#148;. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The offering
of an indeterminate amount of the Trust&#146;s Shares is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;1933 Act&#148;). The offering is intended to
be a continuous offering. The Trust is not a fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;), and is not subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. Investors in the Trust will not, therefore, receive
the regulatory protections afforded by funds registered under the 1940 Act. The Sponsor is not an &#147;Investment Adviser&#148; (as defined in Section&nbsp;202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;Advisers
Act&#148;)), and therefore the Sponsor&#146;s provision of services to the Trust will not be governed by the Advisers Act and is not subject to a fiduciary standard of care. The Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange
Act of 1936, as amended (the &#147;CEA&#148;), and the Sponsor is not subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;) as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor. Shareholders in the Trust
will not benefit from the protections afforded to investors in bitcoin futures contracts on regulated futures markets. The Trust&#146;s Shares are neither interests in nor obligations of the Sponsor or the Trustee. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;30, 2023, FMR Capital, Inc. (the &#147;Seed Capital Investor&#148;), an&nbsp;affiliate of the Sponsor, purchased 1 Share at a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">per-Share</FONT> price of $40.00 (the &#147;Seed Share&#148;). Delivery of the Seed Share was made on November&nbsp;30, 2023. Total proceeds to the Trust from the sale of the Seed Share were $40.00.&nbsp;On January&nbsp;9,
2024, the Seed Share was redeemed for cash and the Seed Capital Investor purchased 500,000 Shares at a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">per-Share</FONT> price of $40.00 (the &#147;Seed Baskets&#148;).&nbsp;Total proceeds to the Trust from the sale
of the Seed Baskets were $20,000,000. On January&nbsp;10, 2024, the Trust&nbsp;purchased 437.23970580 bitcoin with the proceeds of the Seed Baskets.&nbsp;The Seed Capital Investor has acted as a statutory underwriter in connection with the Seed
Baskets. See &#147;Seed Capital Investor&#148; for additional information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The price of the Seed Share and the Seed Baskets was determined

future, including such matters as movements in the digital asset markets and indexes that track such movements, the Trust&#146;s operations, the Sponsor&#146;s plans and references to the Trust&#146;s future success and other similar matters, are
forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses the Sponsor has made based on its perception of historical trends,
current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Whether or not actual

business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. Consequently, all the forward-looking statements made
in this Prospectus are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that actual results or developments the Sponsor anticipates will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the expected
consequences to, or have the expected effects on, the Trust&#146;s operations or the value of its Shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Should one or more of these
risks discussed in &#147;Risk Factors&#148; or other uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those described in forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements are
made based on the Sponsor&#146;s beliefs, estimates and opinions on the date the statements are made and neither the Trust nor the Sponsor is under a duty or undertakes an obligation to update forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates
and opinions or other circumstances should change, other than as required by applicable laws. Moreover, neither the Trust, the Sponsor, nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking
statements. Investors are therefore cautioned against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements. </P>

Origin Bitcoin Fund (the &#147;Trust&#148;) is an exchange-traded product that issues shares of beneficial interest (the &#147;Shares&#148;) that seeks to list and trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the &#147;Exchange&#148;). The Trust&#146;s
investment objective is to seek to track the performance of bitcoin, as measured by the performance of the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate (the &#147;Index&#148;), adjusted for the Trust&#146;s expenses and other liabilities. The Index is
constructed using bitcoin price feeds from eligible bitcoin spot markets and a volume-weighted median price (&#147;VWMP&#148;) methodology, calculated every 15 seconds based on VWMP spot market data over rolling sixty-minute increments. The Index is
designed to reflect the performance of bitcoin in U.S. dollars. In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust holds bitcoin. The Trust is sponsored by FD Funds Management LLC (the &#147;Sponsor&#148;), a wholly owned subsidiary of FMR
LLC. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust provides exposure to the value of bitcoin, and the Shares of the Trust are valued on a daily basis using the same
methodology used to calculate the Index. The Trust provides investors with the opportunity to access the market for bitcoin through a traditional brokerage account without the potential barriers to entry or risks involved with holding or
transferring bitcoin directly, acquiring it from a bitcoin spot market, or mining it. The Trust is passively managed and does not pursue active management investment strategies. The Trust keeps custody of its bitcoin at an affiliate of the Sponsor,
Fidelity Digital Asset Services, LLC (&#147;FDAS&#148; or the &#147;Custodian&#148;), a New York state limited purpose trust company that provides custody and trade execution services for digital assets. The Trust will not invest in derivatives. The
Sponsor believes that the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in bitcoin without purchasing, holding and trading bitcoin directly. </P>

The Bitcoin network is accessed through software, and software governs the creation, movement, and ownership of &#147;bitcoin,&#148; the unit of account on the Bitcoin network ledger. The value
of bitcoin is determined, in part, by the supply of, and demand for, bitcoin in the global markets for trading bitcoin, market expectations for the adoption of bitcoin as a decentralized store of value and medium of exchange, the number of merchants
and/or institutions that accept bitcoin as a form of payment and the volume of private

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bitcoin transaction and ownership records are reflected on the &#147;Bitcoin Blockchain,&#148; which is a digital public record or ledger.
Copies of this ledger are stored in a decentralized manner on the computers of each Bitcoin network node (a node is a computer that runs the software of the Bitcoin network, allowing it to store and validate transactions on the network). Transaction
data is permanently recorded in files called &#147;blocks,&#148; which reflect transactions that have been recorded and authenticated by Bitcoin network participants. The Bitcoin network software source code includes protocols that govern the
creation of new bitcoin and the cryptographic system that secures and verifies bitcoin transactions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bitcoin has generally exhibited high
price volatility relative to more traditional asset classes. One volatility measure, standard deviation, is based on the variability of historical price returns. A higher standard deviation indicates a wider dispersion of past price returns and thus
greater historical volatility. The table below provides information regarding the price return of bitcoin and its volatility from December&nbsp;31, 2021 to June 30, 2024. Standard deviation is annualized. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bitcoin network has a limited history relative to traditional commodities and currencies. There is no assurance that use or acceptance of
bitcoin will continue to grow. A contraction in use or adoption of bitcoin may result in increased volatility or a reduction in the price of bitcoin, which would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the Shares. Sales of newly created or
&#147;mined&#148; bitcoin may cause the price of bitcoin to decline, which could negatively affect an investment in the Shares. Bitcoin trading prices experience high levels of volatility, and in some cases such volatility has been sudden and
extreme. Because of such volatility, owners of beneficial interests of Shares (&#147;Shareholders&#148;) could lose all or substantially all of their investment in the Trust in a very short time, even in the course of one day. Shareholders who
invest in the Trust should actively manage and monitor their investments. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bitcoin network could cease to be a focal point for
developer activity, and there is no assurance that the most active developers who participate in monitoring and upgrading the software protocols on which the Bitcoin network is based will continue to do so in the future, which could damage the
network or reduce bitcoin&#146;s competitiveness with competing digital assets or blockchain protocols. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Spot markets on which bitcoin
trades are relatively new and largely unregulated or may not be complying with existing regulations and, therefore, may be more exposed to fraud and security breaches than established, regulated exchanges for other financial assets or instruments,
which could have a negative impact on the performance of the Trust. Disruptions at bitcoin spot markets, futures markets and in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">over-the-counter</FONT></FONT> (&#147;OTC&#148;)
markets could adversely affect the availability of bitcoin and the ability of Authorized Participants (as defined below) to purchase or sell bitcoin or bitcoin derivatives (or provide cash in relation thereto) and therefore their ability to create
and redeem Shares of the Trust. The loss or destruction of certain &#147;private keys,&#148; including by the Custodian, could prevent the Trust from accessing its bitcoin. Loss of these private keys may be irreversible and could result in the loss
of all or substantially all of an investment in the Trust. Loss of private keys may also impede the Trust&#146;s ability to operate, including by limiting the Trust&#146;s ability to transfer bitcoin in the face of a redemption request and forcing
the Trust to consider liquidation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Risks Associated with the Index </I></B></P>

investment in the Trust. In addition, the value of bitcoin as calculated by the Index methodology may differ from the value of bitcoin calculated by other methodologies and the price of bitcoin on any single spot market. </P>

inherent in the bitcoin market that may cause the price of bitcoin to fluctuate widely. Shareholders considering a purchase of Shares of the Trust should carefully consider what percentage of their total assets should be exposed to the bitcoin
market, and should fully understand, be willing to assume, and have the financial resources necessary to withstand, the risks involved in the Trust&#146;s investment strategy, and be in a position to bear the potential loss of their entire
investment in the Trust. Because the value of bitcoin, and thus the value of the Shares, may be extremely volatile, Shareholders will need to monitor their investment frequently. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is no assurance that the Trust will generate a profit for investors. In addition, an actual or perceived breach of the Trust&#146;s
account with the Custodian could harm the Trust&#146;s operations, result in partial or total loss of the Trust&#146;s assets, damage the Trust&#146;s reputation and negatively affect the market perception of the effectiveness of the Trust, all of
which could in turn reduce demand for the Shares, resulting in a reduction in the price of the Shares. The Trust may also cease operations, the occurrence of which could similarly result in a reduction in the price of the Shares. Any investment made
in the Trust may result in a total loss of the investment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust&#146;s return will not match the performance of the Index because

any expense that qualifies as an Extraordinary Expense will be deemed to be an Extraordinary Expense and not a Sponsor-paid Expense. There is no cap on the amount of Sponsor-paid Expenses. The Sponsor has also assumed all fees and expenses related

incurred in connection with transfers or sales of bitcoin to pay Extraordinary Expenses, the Trust will bear such fees. The Trust will seek to transfer or sell bitcoin at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as
they become due. With respect to transfers or sales necessary to pay Trust expenses and liabilities that are denominated other than in bitcoin, the amount of bitcoin transferred or sold may vary from time to time depending on the actual sales price
of bitcoin relative to the Trust&#146;s expenses and liabilities (e.g., if the price of bitcoin falls, the amount of bitcoin needed to be transferred or sold to pay an expense or liability denominated in U.S. dollars will increase). To the extent
the Trust must buy or sell bitcoin, the Trust may do so through a third-party digital asset broker or dealer, including affiliates of the Sponsor and the Custodian. The Sponsor will select third party brokers or dealers that it believes have

represented to the Sponsor that the percentage of assets maintained in cold versus hot storage&nbsp;including target percentages may change over time and&nbsp;is determined by ongoing risk analysis and market dynamics, in which the
Custodian&nbsp;balances&nbsp;anticipated liquidity needs for its customers as a class against the anticipated greater security of cold storage. The Sponsor has no control over the percentage of bitcoin that the Custodian maintains in omnibus cold

are generated on devices that are not and never have been connected to the internet so that they are resistant to being hacked. The Custodian has multiple, redundant cold storage sites, which are geographically distributed including sites within the
United States. Cold storage locations of the Custodian are monitored by 24x7 <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-site</FONT> security, video surveillance and alarms, and hardened room structures, and access to these facilities is controlled by
multi-person controls, multi-team access rules, and multi-factor authentication. The private keys related to the Trust&#146;s bitcoin are not accessible to any person or entity except the Custodian, including the Sponsor. The Sponsor and the

device or storing the private keys on a storage device or printed medium and deleting the keys from all computers. The Custodian may receive deposits of bitcoin but may not send bitcoin without use of the corresponding private keys. Outbound bitcoin

regular trading, as promptly as practical after 4:00 p.m. EST. The NAV of the Trust is the aggregate value of the Trust&#146;s assets less its accrued but unpaid liabilities (which include accrued expenses). In determining the Trust&#146;s NAV, the
Administrator values the bitcoin held by the Trust based on the price set by the Index as of 4:00 p.m. EST. The Administrator also determines the NAV per Share. For purposes of the Trust&#146;s financial statements, the Trust will utilize a pricing
source that is consistent with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;), as of the financial statement measurement date, which may result in valuations that differ from the Trust&#146;s daily NAV calculations. The Sponsor

liabilities). For a subscription for Shares, the subscription shall be in the amount of cash needed to purchase the amount of bitcoin represented by the Basket being created, as calculated by the Administrator. For a redemption of Shares, the
Sponsor shall arrange for the bitcoin represented by the Basket to be sold and the cash proceeds distributed. Authorized Participants will deliver, or facilitate the delivery of, cash to the Trust&#146;s account with the Cash Custodian in exchange
for Shares when they purchase Shares, and the Trust will deliver cash to such Authorized Participants when they redeem Shares with the Trust. Further, Authorized Participants will not directly or indirectly purchase, hold, deliver, or receive
bitcoin as part of the creation or redemption process or otherwise direct the Trust or a third party with respect to purchasing, holding, delivering, or receiving bitcoin as part of the creation or redemption process. Shares initially comprising the
same Basket but offered by the Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices, which depend on various factors, including the supply and demand for Shares, the value of the Trust&#146;s assets, and market
conditions at the time of a transaction. Shareholders who buy or sell Shares during the day from their broker may do so at a premium or discount relative to the NAV of the Shares of the Trust. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The trading prices of many digital assets, including bitcoin, have experienced extreme volatility in recent periods and may continue to do so.
For instance, there were steep increases in the value of certain digital assets, including bitcoin, over the course of 2017, followed by steep drawdowns throughout 2018 in digital asset trading prices, including for bitcoin. These drawdowns
notwithstanding, digital asset prices, including bitcoin, increased significantly again during 2019, decreased significantly again in the first quarter of 2020 amidst broader market declines as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak and
increased significantly again over the remainder of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. Digital asset prices, including bitcoin, continued to experience significant and sudden changes throughout 2021 followed by steep drawdowns in the fourth quarter
of 2021, and throughout 2022, and digital asset prices have continued to fluctuate to date in 2023. In particular, digital asset prices have experienced extreme volatility since November 2022 when FTX Trading Ltd. (&#147;FTX&#148;) halted customer
withdrawals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Extreme volatility in the future, including further declines in the trading prices of bitcoin, could have a material adverse
effect on the value of the Shares and the Shares could lose all or substantially all of their value. Furthermore, a lack of regulatory clarity may reduce confidence in the digital asset economy and may result in greater volatility in the price of
bitcoin and other digital assets, including a depreciation in value. The Trust is not actively managed and will not take any actions to take advantage, or mitigate the impacts, of volatility in the price of bitcoin. </P>

2022, digital asset lenders Celsius Network LLC and Voyager Digital Ltd. and digital asset hedge fund Three Arrows Capital each declared bankruptcy, and the stablecoin TerraUSD collapsed. These events caused a loss of confidence in participants in

rumors of the company&#146;s liquidity issues and likely insolvency. Shortly thereafter, FTX&#146;s CEO resigned and FTX and numerous affiliates of FTX filed for bankruptcy. The U.S. Department of Justice subsequently brought criminal charges,
including charges of fraud, violations of federal securities laws, money laundering, and campaign finance offenses, against FTX&#146;s former CEO and others. FTX is also under investigation by the SEC, the Justice Department, and the Commodity

regulatory and enforcement scrutiny has increased, including from the DOJ, the SEC, the CFTC, the White House and Congress. In addition, several other entities in the digital asset industry filed for bankruptcy following FTX&#146;s bankruptcy

and enact new laws and regulations to regulate digital asset intermediaries, such as digital asset trading platforms and custodians. The U.S. regulatory regime &#150; namely the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies (e.g.,
the SEC, the CFTC, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#147;FinCEN&#148;), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) as well as the White House have issued
reports and releases concerning digital assets, including bitcoin and digital asset markets. However, the extent and content of any forthcoming laws and regulations are not yet ascertainable with certainty, and it may not be ascertainable in the
near future. It is possible that new laws and increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny may require the Trust to comply with certain regulatory regimes, which could result in new costs for the Trust. The Trust may have to devote increased time
and attention to regulatory matters, which could increase costs to the Trust. New laws, regulations and regulatory actions could significantly restrict or eliminate the market for, or uses of, digital assets including bitcoin, which could have a

performance record for the price of bitcoin and, in turn, a limited basis for evaluating an investment in bitcoin. Although past performance is not necessarily indicative of future result, if bitcoin had a more established history, such history
might (or might not) provide investors with more information on which to evaluate an investment in the trust. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Spot markets on which

new and, in some cases, unregulated or may not be complying with existing regulations. Several digital asset trading platforms are unlicensed, unregulated, operate without extensive supervision by governmental authorities, and do not provide the
public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management team, corporate practices, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the U.S., digital asset trading platforms may not be subject to, or may not comply with, regulations governing the operation of national
securities exchanges or designated contract markets. Furthermore, while many prominent digital asset trading platforms provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices and
regulatory compliance, many digital asset trading platforms do not provide this information. Furthermore, because these platforms are largely unregulated or may not be complying with existing regulations, there is an increased risk of fraud,
manipulation and other malfeasance on these platforms, both by malicious third-party actors or the platforms&#146; own personnel. For example, persons with access to trade order information on a digital asset trading platform may use such
information to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;front-run&#148;</FONT> those orders, which may go undetected in part due to the lack of regulations requiring those platforms to adopt deterrence mechanisms. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside the U.S., digital asset trading platforms may be subject to significantly less stringent regulatory and compliance requirements in
their local jurisdictions. As a result, trading activity on or reported by these digital asset trading platforms is generally significantly less regulated than trading in regulated U.S. securities and commodities markets, and may reflect behavior
that would be prohibited in regulated U.S. trading venues. For example, in 2019 there were reports claiming that 80.95% of bitcoin trading volume on digital asset trading platforms was false or noneconomic in nature, with specific focus on
unregulated platforms located outside of the United States. Such reports may indicate that the digital asset trading platform market is significantly smaller than expected and that the U.S. makes up a significantly larger percentage of the digital
asset trading platform </P>

manipulative activity, business failure or security breaches. In many of these instances, the customers of such digital asset trading platforms were not compensated or made whole for the partial or complete losses of their account balances in such
digital asset trading platforms. While, generally speaking, smaller digital asset trading platforms are less likely to have the infrastructure and capitalization that make larger digital asset trading platforms more stable, larger digital asset
trading platforms are more likely to be appealing targets for hackers and malware and may be more likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement action. For example, the collapse of Mt.&nbsp;Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in
late February 2014, demonstrated that even the largest digital asset trading platforms could be subject to abrupt failure with consequences for both users of digital asset trading platforms and the digital asset industry as a whole. In particular,
in the two weeks that followed the February&nbsp;7, 2014 halt of bitcoin withdrawals from Mt.&nbsp;Gox, the value of one bitcoin fell on other platforms from around $795 on February&nbsp;6, 2014 to $578 on February&nbsp;20, 2014. Additionally, in

Bitfinex, a large digital asset trading platform. The value of bitcoin and other digital assets immediately decreased over 10% following reports of the theft at Bitfinex. In November 2022, FTX, one of the largest digital asset trading platforms by
volume at the time, halted customer withdrawals amid rumors of the company&#146;s liquidity issues and likely insolvency, which were subsequently corroborated by its CEO. Shortly thereafter, FTX&#146;s CEO resigned and FTX and many of its affiliates
filed for bankruptcy in the United States, while other affiliates have entered insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceedings around the globe, following which the U.S. Department of Justice brought criminal fraud and other charges, and the SEC and
CFTC brought civil securities and commodities fraud charges, against certain of FTX&#146;s and its affiliates&#146; senior executives, including its former CEO. Around the same time, there were reports that approximately <FONT

value, leading to greater volatility that could adversely affect the value of the Shares. Momentum pricing typically is associated with growth stocks and other assets whose valuation, as determined by the investing public, is impacted by
appreciation in value. Momentum pricing may result in speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of digital assets, which inflates prices and leads to increased volatility. As a result, bitcoin may be more likely to fluctuate in value

assets based upon computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocols. Bitcoin is a prominent, but not unique, part of this industry. The growth of this industry is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Currently, market speculators
and investors generate a significant portion of demand for bitcoin, which can contribute to price volatility. This price volatility in turn limits the adoption of bitcoin as a means of payment for goods and services. Although certain merchants and
major retail and commercial businesses have begun accepting bitcoin as a means of payment for goods and services, consumer use of bitcoin as a means of payment remains limited. A lack of expansion by bitcoin into retail and commercial markets or a
contraction of such use may result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin, which could adversely affect an investment in the Trust. </P>

than a substantial majority of users and miners consent to the proposed modification, and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification. In other words, two incompatible networks would then exist: (1)&nbsp;one
network running the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-modified</FONT> software and (2)&nbsp;another network running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of bitcoin running in parallel, yet
lacking interchangeability. This is in contrast to a &#147;soft fork,&#148; or a proposed modification to the software governing the network that results in a post-update network that is compatible with the network as it existed prior to the update,
because it restricts the network operations that can be performed after the update. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Forks occur for a variety of reasons. A fork could
occur after a significant security breach. Participants on the network could elect to &#147;fork&#148; the network to its state before the hack, effectively reversing the hack. A fork could also be introduced by an unintentional, unanticipated
software flaw in the multiple versions of otherwise compatible software run by users. Such a fork could adversely affect bitcoin&#146;s viability. It is possible, however, that a substantial number of users and miners could adopt an incompatible
version of the digital asset while resisting <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">community-led</FONT> efforts to merge the two chains. This would result in a permanent fork. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A fork may occur as a result of disagreement among network participants as to whether a proposed modification to the network should be

increase the rate of transactions that the Bitcoin network can process. Since then, the Bitcoin network has forked several times to launch new digital assets, such as Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Silver and Bitcoin Diamond. </P>

actors that gained more than 50% of the processing power of the Ethereum Classic network. The attacks resulted in reorganizations of the Ethereum Classic blockchain that allowed the attacker or attackers to reverse previously recorded transactions
in excess of $5.0&nbsp;million and $1.0&nbsp;million. Any similar attacks on the Bitcoin network could negatively impact the value of bitcoin and the value of the Shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the past, mining pools have gained control of significant amounts of the processing power or &#147;hash rate&#148; of the Bitcoin network.
If a mining pool obtains control of more than 50% of the hash rate of the Bitcoin network, a malicious actor would be able to gain full control of the network and the ability to alter the blockchain. During May and June 2014, mining pool
GHash.IO&#146;s processing power approached and during a twenty-four to forty-eight hour period, may have exceeded 50% of the processing power on the Bitcoin network. Although no malicious activity or abnormal transaction recording was observed at
the time, the incident focused attention on the influence of mining pools. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, certain hardware providers may create hardware that
collectively has majority power and the manufacturer could potentially exert control itself. For example, it was discovered that the mining machines produced by Bitmain contained backdoor code that would allow Bitmain to remotely shut down the
mining machines. This vulnerability is colloquially referred to as the &#147;Antbleed backdoor.&#148; At worst, the Antbleed backdoor could have allowed Bitmain to shut off up to an estimated 70% of the global hash rate. Bitmain released an official
response to the controversy claiming that the Antbleed backdoor had no malicious intent, and on April 28, 2017, the day following the discovery of the Antbleed backdoor, Bitmain released new source code and firmware upgrades for its mining hardware
to remove the backdoor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the feasibility of a bad actor gaining control of the processing power on the Bitcoin network increases, there
may be a negative effect on an investment in the Trust. To the extent that the Bitcoin ecosystem, including the core developers and the administrators of mining pools, does not act to ensure greater decentralization of mining processing power, the
feasibility of a malicious actor obtaining control of the processing power on the Bitcoin network will increase, which may adversely affect the value of the Shares. </P>

challenges due to the fact that public blockchains generally face a tradeoff between security and scalability. One means through which public blockchains achieve security is decentralization, which means that transactions are validated through a
dispersed network of nodes running without a central authority. Although this structure makes it difficult for a bad actor to manipulate the network, it also makes validating transactions and the state of the blockchain a slow and resource-intensive
process. As a result, a digital asset network may be limited in the number of transactions it can process by the capabilities of each single fully participating node. Many developers are actively researching and testing scalability solutions for
public blockchains that do not necessarily result in lower levels of security or decentralization, such as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-chain</FONT> payment channels and sharding. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Off-chain</FONT> payment
channels would allow parties to transact without requiring the full processing power of a blockchain. Sharding can increase the scalability of a database, such as a blockchain, by splitting the data processing responsibility among many nodes,
allowing for parallel processing and validating of transactions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of July 2024 the Bitcoin network handled approximately seven
transactions per second. In an effort to increase the volume of transactions that can be processed on a given digital asset network, many digital assets are being upgraded with various features to increase the speed and throughput of digital asset
transactions. For example, in August 2017, the Bitcoin network was upgraded with a technical feature known as &#147;Segregated Witness&#148; that potentially doubles the transactions per second that can be handled
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-chain.</FONT> More importantly, Segregated Witness also enables <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">so-called</FONT> second layer solutions, such as the Lightning Network, or payment channels that greatly increase
transaction throughput (i.e., millions of transactions per second). Wallets and &#147;intermediaries,&#148; or connecting nodes that facilitate payment channels, that support Segregated Witness or Lightning Network-like technologies have not yet
seen wide-scale use. Additionally, questions remain regarding Lightning Network services, such as its cost and who will serve as intermediaries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2021, the Bitcoin protocol implemented the Taproot upgrade to add enhanced support for complex transactions on the network such as
multi-signature transactions, which require two or more parties to execute a transaction on the Bitcoin network. Prior to the upgrade, multi-signature transactions were historically slow, expensive, and easily identifiable. Taproot is intended to
reduce the amount of data written to a block and makes multi-signature transactions indistinguishable from regular transactions, adding an enhanced layer of privacy. However, Taproot also relaxed certain types of data requirements enforced by the
Bitcoin Blockchain to facilitate these changes which led to the launch of the &#147;ordinal protocol.&#148; The ordinal protocol takes advantage of Taproot&#146;s relaxed data requirements to allow users to add graphic images and other data files to
Bitcoin transactions (&#147;Ordinals&#148;). By the end of 2023, nearly 53&nbsp;million Ordinals had been inscribed to the Bitcoin Blockchain. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As corresponding increases in throughput lag behind growth in the use of digital asset networks, average fees and settlement times may
increase considerably. For example, the Bitcoin network has been, at times, at capacity, which has led to increased transaction fees. Since January&nbsp;1, 2019, bitcoin transaction fees have increased from $0.18 per bitcoin transaction, on average,
to a high of $60.95 per transaction, on average, on April&nbsp;20, 2021. As of December&nbsp;31, 2022, bitcoin transaction fees were $1.17 per transaction, on average. Increased fees and decreased settlement speeds could preclude certain uses for
bitcoin (e.g., micropayments), and could reduce demand for, and the price of, bitcoin, which could adversely impact the value of the Shares. In May 2023, events related to the adoption of ordinals, which are a means of inscribing digital content on
the Bitcoin Blockchain, caused transaction fees to temporarily spike above $30 per transaction. As of June 30, 2024, bitcoin transaction fees were averaging $1.63 per transaction. </P>

volatility in digital assets more broadly. Questions about the sufficiency of the backing of certain stablecoins has caused the prices for such stablecoins to fluctuate, which fluctuations may
affect the price of bitcoin. For example, some have argued that the issuance of Tether has been used to artificially increase demand for bitcoin, thereby inflating its price. On February 17, 2021 the New York Attorney General entered an agreement
with Tether&#146;s operators, requiring them to cease any further trading activity with New York persons and pay $18.5&nbsp;million in penalties for false and misleading statements made regarding the assets backing Tether. On October&nbsp;15, 2021,
the CFTC announced a settlement with Tether&#146;s operators in which they agreed to pay $41&nbsp;million in fines to settle charges that, among others, Tether&#146;s claims that it maintained sufficient U.S. dollar reserves to back every Tether
stablecoin in circulation with the &#147;equivalent amount of corresponding fiat currency&#148; held by Tether were untrue. In another example, in May 2022, the digital asset TerraUSD (UST) lost its $1 peg. As UST
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;de-pegged,&#148;</FONT> the custodian of UST&#146;s bitcoin reserves, the Luna Foundation Guard, sold bitcoin to buy UST in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-peg</FONT>
the price of UST to its $1 peg. It is believed that the foregoing action by the Luna Foundation Guard exacerbated a bitcoin <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sell-off</FONT> that adversely affected the price of bitcoin. Similar future occurrences may

stablecoin issued by Circle Internet Financial that is commonly used as a method of payment in digital asset markets, including the bitcoin market. An affiliate of the Sponsor acts as investment manager to a money market fund, the Circle Reserve
Fund, which the issuer of USDC uses to hold reserves backing USDC stablecoins. While USDC is designed to maintain a stable value at 1 U.S. dollar at all times, on March&nbsp;10, 2023, the value of USDC fell below $1.00 for multiple days after Circle
Internet Financial disclosed that US$3.3&nbsp;billion of the USDC reserves were held at Silicon Valley Bank, which had entered Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation receivership earlier that day. Stablecoins are reliant on the U.S. banking system

incentivize miners to continue to dedicate processing power to the blockchain. If transaction confirmation fees become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to use bitcoin. Increased transaction fees may motivate market participants, such as
merchants or commercial institutions, to switch from bitcoin to another digital asset or back to fiat currency as their preferred medium of exchange. Decreased demand for bitcoin may adversely affect its price, which may adversely affect an

record transactions in solved blocks, such transactions will not be recorded on the Bitcoin Blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees. Miners have historically accepted relatively low
transaction confirmation fees because miners have a very low marginal cost of validating unconfirmed transactions. If miners collude in an anticompetitive manner to reject low transaction fees, then bitcoin users could be forced to pay higher fees,

and launch their operations. In addition, because successful mining of a digital asset that uses &#147;proof of work&#148; validation requires maintaining or exceeding a certain level of computing power relative to other validators, miners will need
to upgrade their mining hardware periodically to keep up with their competition. The development of supercomputers with disproportionate computing power may threaten the integrity of the bitcoin market by concentrating mining power, which would make
it unprofitable for other miners to mine. The expense of purchasing or upgrading new equipment may be substantial and diminish returns to miners dramatically. A decline in miners may result in a decrease in the value of bitcoin and the value of the

operations have rapidly evolved over the past several years from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units and first-generation ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) machines. New processing power is
predominantly added to the Bitcoin network currently by &#147;professionalized&#148; mining operations. Such operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. Significant capital is necessary

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A professional mining operation operating at a low profit margin may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined bitcoin
rapidly, and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit margin environment, a higher percentage of the new bitcoin mined each day will be sold into the bitcoin market more rapidly, thereby
reducing bitcoin prices. The network effect of reduced profit margins resulting in greater sales of newly mined bitcoin could result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin that could adversely affect an investment in the Trust. </P>

costs account for a significant portion of the overall mining costs. The availability and cost of electricity will restrict the geographic locations of mining activities. High costs of electricity may incentivize miners to redirect their resources
to other validation protocols, such a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">proof-of-stake</FONT></FONT> blockchains, or abandon their validation activities entirely. A significant decrease in the computational resources
dedicated to the Bitcoin network&#146;s validation protocol could reduce the security of the network which may erode bitcoin&#146;s viability as a store of value or means of exchange. In addition, the significant consumption of electricity may have
a negative environmental impact, including contribution to climate change, which may give rise to public opinion against allowing the use of electricity for bitcoin mining activities or government measures restricting or prohibiting the use of
electricity for bitcoin mining activities. Any such developments could lower the demand for bitcoin and have a material and adverse effect on the price of bitcoin. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concerns have been raised about the electricity required to secure and maintain digital asset networks. For example, as of October&nbsp;31,
2023, over 462&nbsp;million tera hashes were performed every second in connection with mining on the Bitcoin network. Although measuring the electricity consumed by this process is difficult because these operations are performed by various machines
with varying levels of efficiency, the process consumes a significant amount of energy. Further, in addition to the direct energy costs of performing calculations on any given digital asset network, there are indirect costs that impact a
network&#146;s total energy consumption, including the costs of cooling the machines that perform these calculations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Driven by concerns
around energy consumption and the impact on public utility companies, various states and cities have implemented, or are considering implementing, moratoriums on mining activity in their jurisdictions. For example, in November 2022, New York imposed
a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-year</FONT> moratorium on new <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">proof-of-work</FONT></FONT> mining permits at fossil fuel plants in the state. A significant reduction in mining
activity as a result of such actions could adversely affect the security of the Bitcoin network by making it easier for a malicious actor or botnet to manipulate the Bitcoin network. If regulators or public utilities take action that restricts or
otherwise impacts mining activities, such actions could result in decreased security of a digital asset network, including the Bitcoin network, and consequently adversely impact the value of the Shares. </P>

locate an appropriate hedge counterparty, extreme volatility in the price of bitcoin, wide spreads between prices quotes on different bitcoin trading platforms, etc.), such conditions may make it difficult to create or redeem Baskets or cause them
to not create or redeem Baskets. In addition, the hedging mechanisms employed by Authorized Participants and market makers to hedge their exposure to bitcoin may not function as intended, which may make it more difficult for them to enter into such
transactions. Such events could negatively impact the market price of Shares and the spread at which Shares trade on the open market. To the extent Authorized Participants wish to use futures to hedge their exposure, note that while growing in
recent years, the market for exchange-traded bitcoin futures has a limited trading history and operational experience and may be less liquid, more volatile and more vulnerable to economic, market and industry changes than more established futures
markets. The liquidity of the market will depend on, among other things, the adoption of bitcoin and the commercial and speculative interest in the market. </P>

involves more complex operational steps (and therefore execution risk) than the originally contemplated <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-kind</FONT> creation and redemption models. Such delays could cause the execution price associated with such
trades to materially deviate from the Index price used to determine the NAV. Even though the Authorized Participant is responsible for the dollar cost of such difference in prices, Authorized Participants could default on their obligations to the
Trust, or such potential risks and costs could lead Authorized Participants, who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem Baskets to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the price of the Shares and
the price of the underlying bitcoin, to elect to not participate in the Trust&#146;s Share creation and redemption processes. This may adversely affect the arbitrage mechanism intended to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the price of
bitcoin, and as a result, the price of the Shares may fall or otherwise diverge from NAV. If the arbitrage mechanism is not effective, purchases or sales of Shares on the secondary market could occur at a premium or discount to NAV, which could harm
Shareholders by causing them to buy Shares at a price higher than the value of the underlying bitcoin held by the Trust or sell Shares at a price lower than the value of the underlying bitcoin held by the Trust, causing Shareholders to suffer

effectiveness of the arbitrage process in maintaining the relationship between the underlying value of the Trust&#146;s bitcoin and the market price of the Shares.&nbsp;To the extent that other Authorized Participants do not step forward to engage

service offerings) may expose the Trust to potential risks linked to cyber-security breaches of those technological or information systems. The Sponsor believes that the Trust&#146;s bitcoin held in the Trust&#146;s account with the Custodian will
be an appealing target to hackers or malware distributors seeking to destroy, damage or steal the Trust&#146;s bitcoin or private keys and will only become more appealing as the Trust&#146;s assets grow. While the Trust, the Sponsor and the
Custodian have implemented procedures to identify and or stop new security threats and expect to adapt to technological changes in the digital asset industry, to the extent such efforts are unsuccessful the Trust&#146;s bitcoin may be subject to
theft, loss, destruction or other attack. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, access to the Trust&#146;s bitcoin could be restricted by natural events (such as
an earthquake or flood) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack). The Sponsor has evaluated the security procedures in place for safeguarding the Trust&#146;s bitcoin. Nevertheless, the security procedures cannot guarantee the prevention of any
loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God that may be borne by the Trust. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The security procedures and operational
infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee of the Sponsor, the Custodian, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Trust&#146;s account with the
Custodian, the private keys (and therefore bitcoin) or other data of the Trust. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of the Sponsor, the Custodian, or the Trust&#146;s other service providers to disclose
sensitive information in order to gain access to the Trust&#146;s infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a
predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Sponsor and the Custodian may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An actual or perceived breach of the Trust&#146;s account with the Custodian could harm the Trust&#146;s operations, result in partial or
total loss of the Trust&#146;s assets, damage the Trust&#146;s reputation and negatively affect the market perception of the effectiveness of the Trust, all of which could in turn reduce demand for the Shares, resulting in a reduction in the price
of the Shares. The Trust may also cease operations, the occurrence of which could similarly result in a reduction in the price of the Shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the Sponsor and the Trust&#146;s service providers have established business continuity plans and systems that they respectively believe
are reasonably designed to prevent cyber attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems including the possibility that certain risks have not been, or cannot be, identified. Service providers may have limited indemnification
obligations to the Trust, which could be negatively impacted as a result, <I>see &#147;Liability and Indemnification&#148; </I>and <I>&#147;Material Contracts&#148; </I>below. </P>

responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the Trust&#146;s claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for the Trust may be limited to the relevant custodian or, to the extent
identifiable, other responsible third parties (for example, a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of the Trust. Similarly, as noted below, the
Trust&#146;s Custodian has limited liability to the Trust, which could adversely affect the Trust&#146;s ability to seek recovery from them, even when the Custodian&#146;s actions or failure to act are the cause of the Trust&#146;s loss. </P>

processes and policies and believes that the current risk management processes and procedures are reasonably designed and effective. The Trust does not normally interact with any digital asset trading platforms, and the Trust&#146;s bitcoin is held
in a cold storage wallet with the Custodian, a duly chartered New York limited liability trust company, pursuant to an express custodial relationship. The Sponsor believes that the security procedures that the Sponsor and the Custodian utilize, such
as hardware redundancy, segregation and offline data storage (i.e., the maintenance of data on computers and/or storage media that is not directly connected to or accessible from the internet and/or networked with other computers, also known as
&#147;cold storage&#148;) protocols are reasonably designed to safeguard the Trust&#146;s bitcoin from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. Despite the number of security procedures that the Sponsor
and Custodian employ, it is impossible to guarantee the prevention of any loss due to a security breach, software defect, act of God, pandemic or riot that may be borne by the Trust. Notwithstanding the above, the Sponsor and the Custodian are
responsible for their own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. In the event that the Trust&#146;s risk management processes and policies prove to not be adequate to prevent any loss of the Trust&#146;s bitcoin and such loss is not
covered by insurance or is otherwise recoverable, the value of the Shares will decrease as a result and investors would experience a decrease in the value of their investment. </P>

the Trust by the Custodian. The Custodian is a limited liability trust company organized under the New York Banking Law and is subject to the supervision of New York Department of Financial Services. The Custodial Services Agreement for Trust assets
contains an agreement by the parties to treat the bitcoin credited to the Trust as financial assets under Article 8 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code (&#147;Article 8&#148;), in addition to stating that the Custodian will serve as a securities
intermediary with respect to such assets. Further, the Custodian has agreed to hold Trust assets for the benefit of the Trust as the entitlement holder, and while the Trust assets will be commingled with assets of the Custodian&#146;s other
customers in an omnibus account, such assets will not be commingled with the Custodian&#146;s proprietary assets. While other types of assets held in a similarly-segregated manner have been deemed not to be part of the asset custodian&#146;s
bankruptcy estate under various regulatory regimes, bankruptcy courts have not yet fully addressed the appropriate treatment of custodial holdings of digital assets and any such determination may be highly fact-specific. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Given that the contractual protections and legal rights of customers with respect to digital assets held on their behalf by third parties are
relatively untested in a bankruptcy or receivership proceeding of an entity such as the Custodian, in the event of an insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Custodian, there is a risk that the Trust&#146;s assets may
be considered the property of the bankruptcy estate of the Custodian, and that customers of the Custodian &#150; including the Trust &#150; may be at risk of being treated as general unsecured creditors of the Custodian and subject to the risk of
total loss or markdowns on value of such assets. Moreover, even if the Trust&#146;s assets ultimately are not treated as part of the Custodian&#146;s bankruptcy estate, the automatic stay could apply until the bankruptcy court made such a
determination, and the limited precedent and fact-dependent nature of the determination could delay or preclude the return of such assets to the Trust. Further, </P>

effect redemptions for cash and, to the extent applicable, other Trust expenses, and in extraordinary circumstances, to effect the liquidation of the Trust&#146;s bitcoin. The Trust relies on the Cash Custodian to hold any cash related to the
purchase or sale of bitcoin. To the extent that the Trust or Sponsor face difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships, the loss of the Trust&#146;s banking partners, including the Cash Custodian, or the imposition of operational
restrictions by these banking partners and the inability of the Trust to utilize other financial institutions may result in a disruption of creation and redemption activity of the Trust, or cause other operational disruptions or adverse effects for
the Trust. In the future, it is possible that the Trust could be unable to establish accounts at new banking partners, or that the banks with which the Trust is able to establish relationships may not be as large or well-capitalized or subject to

the Trust holds customer cash, including the Cash Custodian, fails, becomes insolvent, enters receivership, is taken over by regulators, enters financial distress, or otherwise suffers adverse effects to its financial condition or operational
status. Recently, some banks have experienced financial distress. If the Cash Custodian were to experience financial distress or its financial condition is otherwise affected, the Cash Custodian&#146;s ability to provide services to the Trust could
be affected. Moreover, the future failure of the Cash Custodian or other bank at which the Trust maintains cash could result in losses to the Trust, to the extent the balances are not covered by deposit insurance. As a result, the Trust could suffer

competing products. The Sponsor&#146;s competitors may have greater financial, technical and human resources than the Sponsor. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be effective competitors, particularly through collaborative
arrangements with large and established companies. In addition, the timing of the Trust in reaching the market and the fee structure of the Trust relative to similar products may have a detrimental effect on the scale and sustainability of the
Trust. The Sponsor&#146;s competitors may be able to launch similar products to the Trust before the launch of the Trust due to, for example, the satisfaction of all regulatory requirements required to launch before the Trust is able to do so.
Accordingly, the Sponsor&#146;s competitors may commercialize a product involving bitcoin more rapidly or effectively than the Sponsor is able to, which could adversely affect the Sponsor&#146;s competitive position, the likelihood that the Trust
will achieve initial market acceptance and the Sponsor&#146;s ability to generate meaningful revenues from the Trust (i.e., revenues that would commercially justify the Sponsor continuing to devote time and resources to the operation of the Trust),

Although many pricing sources refer to themselves as &#147;exchanges,&#148; they are not registered with, or supervised by, the SEC or CFTC and do not meet the regulatory standards of a national securities exchange or designated contract market. For
these reasons, among others, purchases and sales of bitcoin may be subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including the lack of liquidity in the markets and government regulation and intervention. For example,
on June&nbsp;5, 2023, the SEC filed lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance alleging, among other things, their operation of an unlicensed securities exchange. These circumstances could affect the price of bitcoin used in
Index calculations and, therefore, could adversely affect the level of the Index. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Index is based on various inputs which include

methodology and price feeds from eligible bitcoin spot markets, the Index intends to represent the U.S. dollar value of one bitcoin every 15 seconds based on VWMP spot market data over rolling sixty-minute increments. As such, the VWMP methodology
used to determine the NAV may not be reflective of market events and other developments that occur after its pricing window and thus this methodology may not be reflective of the then-available market price of bitcoin in periods between its
calculation. Additionally, as the methodology references a median price, it may not reflect the price of bitcoin available for the Trust to transact on any single spot market. The Sponsor does not intend, and disclaims any obligation, to determine
whether the methodology used to determine the level of the Index accurately reflects the value of bitcoin or the price at which market transactions in bitcoin could be readily effected at any given time. </P>

have been examining the operations of digital asset networks, digital asset users and the digital asset spot market. Many of these state and federal agencies have brought enforcement actions and issued advisories and rules relating to digital asset

securities exchanges, brokers and clearing agencies. For example, on June&nbsp;5, 2023, the SEC filed lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance alleging, among other things,
their operation of an unlicensed securities exchange. Although the SEC has not alleged that bitcoin is a security, the outcome of these enforcement actions and others may result in the substantial restructuring of the digital asset market in the
United States. Moreover, until these actions are resolved, the structure of the digital asset market in the United States will remain subject to substantial regulatory risk, which may impact the demand for digital assets and the continued
availability of existing exchanges and offerings. The U.S. Congress is also actively preparing new legislation to address certain market structure issues relating to digital assets and stablecoins. The outcome of this legislation is unknown. Both
the outcome of the pending SEC enforcement actions and federal legislation are highly uncertain and may alter, perhaps to a materially adverse extent, the nature of an investment in the Shares and/or the ability of the Trust to continue to operate.

broad authority over the regulation of issuances of securities (including digital asset securities) and commodity interests (including derivative instruments utilizing or referencing digital assets). The SEC and CFTC&#146;s engagement with the
digital asset industry has had a material impact on the development of digital asset markets, including initial coin offerings, margin trading, regulated and unregulated derivatives markets, and decentralized finance markets. For example, the SEC
has issued guidance as to the application of the securities laws to digital assets and initiated enforcement actions against certain digital asset issuers and offerings on the basis that such digital assets and offerings are securities under U.S.
securities laws. In these actions, the SEC reasoned that the unregistered offer and sale of digital assets can, in certain circumstances, including ICOs, be considered an illegal public offering of securities. Similarly, the CFTC, together with the
Department of Justice, has initiated enforcement actions against digital asset trading platforms relating to violations of the CEA, on the basis that such platforms engaged in illegal, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-exchange</FONT> retail
commodity transactions in digital assets and digital asset derivative transactions. Further enforcement actions against participants in the digital asset industry could have negative impacts the price of digital assets, including bitcoin. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2021, Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the SEC, stated that he believed investors using digital asset trading platforms are not
adequately protected, and that activities on the platforms can implicate the securities laws, commodities laws and banking laws, raising a number of issues related to protecting investors and consumers, guarding against illicit activity, and
ensuring financial stability. Chair Gensler expressed a need for the SEC to have additional authorities to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from &#147;falling between regulatory cracks,&#148; as well as for more resources to protect
investors in &#147;this growing and volatile sector.&#148; Chair Gensler called for federal legislation centering on digital asset trading, lending, and decentralized finance platforms, seeking &#147;additional plenary authority&#148; to write rules
for digital asset trading and lending. It is not possible to predict whether the U.S. Congress will grant additional authorities to the SEC or other regulators, what the nature of such additional authorities might be, how they might impact the
ability of digital assets markets to function or how any new regulations that may flow from such authorities might impact the value of digital assets generally and bitcoin held by the Trust specifically. Subsequent to Chair Gensler&#146;s assertions
in August 2021, in April 2022, he announced that he instructed the SEC staff to work (i)&nbsp;to register and regulate digital asset platforms like securities exchanges; (ii)&nbsp;with the CFTC on how to jointly address digital asset platforms that
trade both securities and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-securities;</FONT> (iii)&nbsp;on segregating out digital asset platforms&#146; custody of customer assets, if appropriate; and (iv)&nbsp;on segregating out the market making functions of
digital asset platforms, if appropriate. At the same time and continuing through the date of this Prospectus, the U.S. Congress continues to consider and debate a variety of proposals regarding how digital assets should be characterized and
regulated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the SEC&#146;s actions targeting digital assets and trading platforms directly, the SEC has also targeted
regulated investments that provide exposure to digital assets indirectly. For example, in a recent letter regarding the SEC&#146;s review of proposed rule changes to list and trade shares of certain bitcoin-related investment vehicles on public
markets, the SEC staff stated that it has significant investor protection concerns regarding the markets for digital assets, including the potential for market manipulation and fraud. In March 2018, it was reported that the SEC was examining as many

The reported focus of the examinations is on the accuracy of risk disclosures to investors in these funds, digital asset pricing practices, and compliance with rules meant to prevent the theft of

and national security risks, and responsible development and use of digital assets. The Executive Order directed federal government departments and agencies to produce various reports, frameworks, analyses, and regulatory and legislative
recommendations to the Biden Administration. The policies and objectives of the Executive Order are broad and, at this time, it is unclear what impact it may have on the regulation of bitcoin and other digital assets. The consequences of increased
federal regulation of digital assets and digital asset activities could have a material adverse effect on the Trust and the Shares. If the Sponsor determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, it may seek to

the Bank Secrecy Act (&#147;BSA&#148;) will apply to cryptocurrency providers. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (&#147;FIT for the 21st Century Act&#148;) advanced through the House and was ultimately passed on
May&nbsp;22, 2024 in a vote along bipartisan lines. The FIT for the 21st Century Act would require the SEC and the CFTC to jointly issue rules or guidance that would outline their process in delisting a digital asset that they deem inconsistent with
the CEA, federal securities laws and the FIT for the 21st Century Act. The bill, in part, would also provide a certification process for blockchains to be recognized as decentralized, which would allow the SEC to challenge claims made by token

rules will govern redeemability and collateral. The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023, as introduced by House Finance Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (the &#147;McHenry bill&#148;), would make it unlawful for any entity other than a
permitted payment stablecoin issuer to issue a payment stablecoin. The McHenry bill would establish bank-like regulation and supervision for federal qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers. These requirements include capital, liquidity and risk
management requirements, application of the Bank Secrecy Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act&#146;s customer privacy requirements, certain activities limits, and broad supervision and enforcement authority. The McHenry bill would grant state
regulators primary supervision, examination and enforcement authority over state stablecoin issuers, leaving the Federal Reserve Board with secondary, backup enforcement authority for &#147;exigent&#148; circumstances. The McHenry bill would also
amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the 1940 Act, the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 to specify that payment stablecoins are not securities for purposes of those federal securities laws. </P>

developers and other related service providers that do not custody customer funds are not money transmitters. The &#147;Financial Technology Protection Act&#148;, another bipartisan measure, would set up an independent Financial Technology Working

While the SEC has not officially affirmed that bitcoin is not a security under U.S. federal securities laws, public statements by senior officials at the SEC, including a June 2018 speech by the director of the SEC&#146;s division of Corporation
Finance, indicate that such officials do not believe that bitcoin is a security. Such statements are not official policy statements by the SEC and reflect only the speaker&#146;s views, which are not binding on the SEC or any other agency or court.
If bitcoin is determined to be a &#147;security&#148; under federal or state securities laws by the SEC or any other agency, or in a proceeding in a court of law or otherwise, it may have material adverse consequences for bitcoin&#146;s utility as a
means of exchange and accordingly for its continued adoption. In the face of such developments, the required registrations and compliance steps may result in extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to the Trust. Specifically, the Trust and the Sponsor
may be subject to additional regulatory requirements including under the 1940 Act, and the Sponsor may be required to register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. If the Sponsor determines not to comply with such additional
regulatory and registration requirements, the Sponsor will terminate the Trust. Any such termination could result in the liquidation of the Trust&#146;s bitcoin at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders. Alternatively, compliance with these
requirements could result in additional expenses to the Trust or significantly limit the ability of the Trust to pursue its investment objective. These additional requirements may result in extraordinary, recurring and/or nonrecurring expenses of
the Trust, thereby materially and adversely impacting the Shares. If the Sponsor and/or the Trust determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, the Sponsor may terminate the Trust. Any such termination could

any tax liability that a Shareholder incurs as a result of holding Shares will need to be satisfied from some other source of funds. For some purposes, however, redemptions will count as distributions, so Shareholders receiving redemption proceeds
after a sale to fund a redemption in cash may be allocated a larger portion of income or gain than those that do not. If a Shareholders sells Shares in order to raise funds to satisfy such a tax liability, the sale itself may generate additional

taxpayer&#146;s basis in the bitcoin. However, because bitcoin is a new technological innovation, because IRS guidance has taken the form of administrative pronouncements that may be modified without prior notice and comment, and because there is as
yet little case law on the subject, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in bitcoin or in transactions relating to investments in bitcoin may change from that described in this Prospectus, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such
change in the U.S. federal income tax treatment of bitcoin may have a negative effect on prices of bitcoin and may adversely affect the value of the Shares. In this regard, the IRS has indicated that it has made it a priority to issue additional
guidance related to the taxation of virtual currency transactions, such as transactions involving bitcoin. While it has started to issue such additional guidance, whether any future guidance will adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of an investment in bitcoin or in transactions relating to investments in bitcoin is unknown. Moreover, future developments that may arise with respect to digital currencies may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of

digital asset resulting from a fork in the Bitcoin network (other than what the Sponsor determines to be bitcoin). If&nbsp;the Trust were to change this policy, the Trust would need to seek and obtain certain regulatory approvals, including an
amendment to the Trust&#146;s registration statement of which this Prospectus is a part and approval of an application by the Exchange to amend its listing rules. Under current IRS guidance, a hard fork resulting in the receipt of new units of
cryptocurrency is a taxable event giving rise to ordinary income equal to the value of the new cryptocurrency. The Trust Agreement requires that if, despite abandoning such digital asset, the Trust receives or claims a forked asset, the Sponsor will
cause the forked asset to be sold and have the proceeds distributed to the Shareholders. Such a sale will give rise to gain or loss, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if the amount realized on the sale differs from the value of the new forked or
air dropped asset at the time it was received by the Trust. A hard fork may therefore give rise to additional tax liabilities for Shareholders. </P>

is based on the decentralized, open source protocol of a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">peer-to-peer</FONT></FONT> electronic network. No single entity owns or operates the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is not issued by
governments, banks or any other centralized authority. The infrastructure of the Bitcoin network is collectively maintained on a distributed basis by the network&#146;s participants, consisting of &#147;miners&#148;, who run special software to
validate transactions, developers, who maintain and contribute updates to the Bitcoin network&#146;s source code, and users, who download and maintain on their individual computer a full or partial copy of the Bitcoin Blockchain and related
software. Anyone can be a user, developer, or miner. The Bitcoin network is accessed through software, and software governs bitcoin&#146;s creation, movement, and ownership. The source code for the Bitcoin network and related software protocol is
open-source, and anyone can contribute to its development. The value of bitcoin is in part determined by the supply of, and demand for, bitcoin in the global markets for the trading of bitcoin, market expectations for the adoption of bitcoin as a
decentralized store of value, the number of merchants and/or institutions that accept bitcoin as a form of payment, and the volume of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">peer-to-peer</FONT></FONT> transactions, among
other factors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bitcoin transaction and ownership records are reflected on the Bitcoin Blockchain. Miners authenticate and bundle bitcoin
transactions sequentially into files called &#147;blocks&#148;, which requires performing computational work to solve a cryptographic puzzle set by the Bitcoin network&#146;s software protocol. Because each solved block contains a reference to the
previous block, they form a chronological &#147;chain&#148; back to the first bitcoin transaction. Copies of the Bitcoin Blockchain are stored in a decentralized manner on the computers of each individual Bitcoin network full node, i.e., any user
who chooses to maintain on their computer a full copy of the Bitcoin Blockchain as well as related software. Each bitcoin is associated with a set of unique cryptographic &#147;keys&#148;, in the form of a string of numbers and letters, which allow
whoever is in possession of the private key to assign that bitcoin in a transfer that the Bitcoin network will recognize. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Bitcoin </B></P>

referred to as a &#147;bitcoin wallet.&#148; A user&#146;s bitcoin wallet can run on a computer or smartphone, and can be used both to send and to receive bitcoin. Within a bitcoin wallet, a user can generate one or more unique &#147;bitcoin
addresses,&#148; which are conceptually similar to bank account numbers on the Bitcoin Blockchain and are associated with a pair of public and private keys. After establishing a bitcoin address, a user can send or receive bitcoin from his or her
bitcoin address to another user&#146;s address using the public and private keys. Sending bitcoin from one bitcoin address to another is similar in concept to sending a bank wire from one person&#146;s bank account to another person&#146;s bank
account. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The amount of bitcoin associated with each bitcoin address is listed in a public ledger, referred to as a
&#147;blockchain.&#148; Copies of the Bitcoin Blockchain exist on thousands of computers on the Bitcoin network throughout the Internet. A user&#146;s bitcoin wallet will either contain a copy of the Bitcoin Blockchain or be able to connect with
another computer that holds a copy of the Bitcoin Blockchain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When a bitcoin user wishes to transfer bitcoin to another user, the sender
must first request a bitcoin address from the recipient. The sender then uses his or her bitcoin wallet software to create a data packet containing the proposed addition (often referred to as a &#147;transaction&#148;) to the Bitcoin Blockchain. The
proposed transaction would reduce the sender&#146;s address and increase the recipient&#146;s address by the amount of bitcoin desired to be transferred, and is sent on a

source project with no official company or group that controls the Bitcoin network, and anyone can review the underlying code and suggest changes. There are, however, a number of individual developers that regularly contribute to a specific
distribution of Bitcoin network software known as the &#147;Bitcoin Core,&#148; and who loosely oversee the development of its source code. There are many other compatible versions of Bitcoin network software, but Bitcoin Core is the most widely
adopted and currently provides the <I>de facto </I>standard for the Bitcoin protocol. The core developers are able to access, and can alter, the Bitcoin network source code and, as a result, they are responsible for quasi-official releases of
updates and other changes to the Bitcoin network&#146;s source code. However, because bitcoin has no central authority, the release of updates to the Bitcoin network&#146;s source code by the core developers does not guarantee that the updates will
be automatically adopted by the other participants in the Bitcoin network. Users and miners must accept any changes made to the Bitcoin network source code by downloading the proposed modification of the Bitcoin network&#146;s source code. A
modification of the Bitcoin network&#146;s source code is effective only with respect to those Bitcoin users and miners who choose to download it. If a modification is accepted by only a percentage of users and miners, a division in the Bitcoin
network will occur such that one network will run the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-modification</FONT> source code and the other network will run the modified source code. Such a division is known as a &#147;fork.&#148; See <I>&#147;Risk
Factors&#151;Risks Associated with bitcoin and the Bitcoin network.&#148; </I>A modification to the source code becomes part of the Bitcoin network only if accepted by participants collectively having most of the processing power on the Bitcoin
network. In recent years, there have been several forks in the Bitcoin network, including, but not limited to, forks resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash (August 1, 2017), Bitcoin Gold (October 24, 2017) and Bitcoin SegWit2X (December 28,

transaction is similar in concept to an irreversible digital check. The transaction contains the sender&#146;s bitcoin address, the recipient&#146;s bitcoin address, the amount of bitcoin to be sent, a transaction fee and the sender&#146;s digital
signature. The sender&#146;s use of his or her digital signature enables participants on the Bitcoin network to verify the authenticity of the bitcoin transaction. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A user&#146;s digital signature is generated via usage of the user&#146;s <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">so-called</FONT> &#147;private
key,&#148; one of two numbers in a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">so-called</FONT> cryptographic &#147;key pair.&#148; A key pair consists of a &#147;public key&#148; and its corresponding private key, both of which are lengthy alphanumeric codes,
derived together and possessing a unique relationship. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Public keys are associated with bitcoin addresses that are publicly known and can
accept a bitcoin transfer. Private keys are used to sign transactions that initiate the transfer of bitcoin from a sender&#146;s bitcoin address to a recipient&#146;s bitcoin address. Only the holder of the private key associated with a particular
bitcoin address can digitally sign a transaction proposing a transfer of bitcoin from that particular bitcoin address. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A user&#146;s
bitcoin address may be safely distributed, but a user&#146;s private key must be kept in accordance with appropriate controls and procedures to ensure it is used only for legitimate and intended transactions. Only by using a private key can a
bitcoin user create a digital signature to transfer bitcoin to another user. In addition, if an unauthorized third person learns of a user&#146;s private key, that third person could forge the user&#146;s digital signature and send the user&#146;s
bitcoin to any arbitrary bitcoin address, thereby stealing the user&#146;s bitcoin. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The usage of key pairs is a cornerstone of the
Bitcoin network. This is because the use of a private key is the only mechanism by which a bitcoin transaction can be signed. If a private key is lost, the corresponding bitcoin is thereafter permanently
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-transferable.</FONT> Moreover, the theft of a private key enables the thief immediate and unfettered access to the corresponding bitcoin. Bitcoin users must therefore understand that in this regard, bitcoin is a
bearer asset, similar to cash: that is, the person or entity in control of the private key corresponding to a particular quantity of bitcoin has <I>de facto </I>control of the bitcoin. For large quantities of bitcoin, holders often employ
sophisticated security measures. For a discussion of how the Trust secures its bitcoin, see &#147;The Custodian&#148; below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bitcoin
network incorporates a system to prevent double spending of a single bitcoin. To prevent the possibility of double-spending a single bitcoin, each validated transaction is recorded, time stamped and publicly displayed in a &#147;block&#148; in the
Bitcoin Blockchain, which is publicly available. Thus, the Bitcoin network provides confirmation against double-spending by memorializing every transaction in the Bitcoin Blockchain, which is publicly accessible and downloaded in part or in whole by
all users of the Bitcoin network software program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process by which bitcoin are created and bitcoin transactions are verified is
called mining. To begin mining, a user, or &#147;miner,&#148; can download special mining software, which, like regular Bitcoin network software programs, turns the user&#146;s computer into a &#147;node&#148; on the Bitcoin network. A node may

individual likelihood of solving new blocks. As more miners join the Bitcoin network and its processing power increases, or if miners leave the Bitcoin network and its processing power declines, the Bitcoin network adjusts the complexity of a

occurs on the Bitcoin network, while the former is an activity that occurs entirely within the order book operated by the spot market. The spot market typically records the investor&#146;s
ownership of bitcoin in its internal books and records, rather than on the Bitcoin Blockchain. The spot market ordinarily does not transfer bitcoin to the investor on the Bitcoin Blockchain unless the investor makes a request to the exchange to

the spot markets, bitcoin can be traded OTC. OTC market participants generally consist of institutional entities, such as firms that offer <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-sided</FONT> liquidity for bitcoin, investment managers, proprietary
trading firms, entities with sizeable bitcoin holdings, and family offices, as well as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">high-net-worth</FONT></FONT> individuals that trade bitcoin on a proprietary basis. The OTC
market provides a relatively flexible market in terms of quotes, price, quantity, and other factors, although it tends to involve large blocks of bitcoin. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry meeting place. Parties engaging in
OTC transactions will agree upon a price&#151;often via phone or email&#151;and then one of the two parties will initiate the transaction. For example, a seller of bitcoin could initiate the transaction by sending the bitcoin to the buyer&#146;s
bitcoin address. The buyer would then wire U.S. dollars to the seller&#146;s bank account. OTC trades are sometimes hedged and eventually settled with concomitant trades on bitcoin spot markets. </P>

of bitcoin derivatives has developed substantially. From July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024, CFTC regulated bitcoin futures represented between $0.36 billion and $8.22&nbsp;billion in notional trading volume on Chicago Mercantile Exchange on a daily

and state financial institution regulators) have been examining the operations of digital asset networks, digital asset users and the digital asset spot markets, with particular focus on the
extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises, and the safety and soundness of spot markets or other service-providers that hold digital assets for users. Many of
these state and federal agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by digital assets to investors. In addition, federal and state agencies have issued rules or guidance about the treatment of digital asset transactions or
requirements for businesses engaged in digital asset activity. As noted previously, the SEC has not asserted regulatory authority over bitcoin or trading or ownership of bitcoin and has not expressed the view that bitcoin should be classified or
treated as a security for purposes of U.S. federal securities laws. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The CFTC has regulatory jurisdiction over the bitcoin futures
markets. In addition, because the CFTC has determined that bitcoin is a &#147;commodity&#148; under the CEA and the rules thereunder, it has jurisdiction to prosecute fraud and manipulation in the cash, or spot, market for bitcoin. The CFTC has
pursued enforcement actions relating to fraud and manipulation involving bitcoin and bitcoin markets. Beyond instances of fraud or manipulation, the CFTC generally does not oversee cash or spot market exchanges or transactions involving bitcoin that
do not use collateral, leverage, or financing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December 1, 2017, two designated contract markets (&#147;DCMs&#148;) registered with
the CFTC self-certified new contracts for bitcoin futures products. DCMs are boards of trades (or exchanges) that operate under the regulatory oversight of the CFTC, pursuant to Section&nbsp;5 of the Commodity Exchange Act. To obtain and maintain
designation as a DCM, an exchange must comply on an initial and ongoing basis with twenty-three Core Principles established in Section&nbsp;5(d) of the CEA. Among other things, DCMs are required to establish self- regulatory programs designed to
enforce the DCM&#146;s rules, prevent market manipulation and customer and market abuses, and ensure the recording and safe storage of trade information. The CFTC engaged in a &#147;heightened review&#148; of the self-certification of bitcoin
futures, which required DCMs to enter direct or indirect information sharing agreements with spot market platforms to allow access to trade and trader data; monitor data from cash markets with respect to price settlements and other bitcoin prices
more broadly, and identify anomalies and disproportionate moves in the cash markets compared to the futures markets; engage in inquiries, including at the trade settlement level when necessary; and agree to regular coordination with CFTC
surveillance staff on trade activities, including providing the CFTC surveillance team with trade settlement data upon request. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Various

exchange-traded product that issues Shares that trade on the Exchange. The Trust&#146;s investment objective is to reflect the performance of bitcoin, as measured by the performance of the Index, adjusted for the Trust&#146;s expenses and
liabilities. In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust holds bitcoin and values its Shares daily based on the same methodology used to calculate the Index. The Trust is sponsored by FD Funds Management LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of FMR LLC. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor believes that the Trust provides a cost-efficient way for Shareholders to implement strategic and tactical asset

bitcoin spot markets and the VWMP methodology, calculated every 15 seconds based on VWMP exchange data over rolling sixty-minute increments to develop a bitcoin price composite. The Index methodology was developed by the Index Provider and is
monitored by the Committee. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Eligible spot markets include all U.S. digital asset trading platforms and/or regulated digital asset trading
platforms selected by the Committee. Such markets will be evaluated quarterly, and the final selections will be made on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December or during market disruptions where a market review is warranted, as
determined by the Committee. New exchanges that meet the eligibility requirements will be considered for inclusion at the quarterly review once there is one week of pricing data available. The current bitcoin spot markets included in the Index
calculation are Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, Kraken, and LMAX Digital. As further described below, the Sponsor and the Trust reasonably believe each of these digital asset trading platforms maintain practices and policies designed to comply
with AML and KYC regulations. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

from the NAV calculation pursuant to which the Trust prices its Shares those bitcoin spot markets with indicia of suspicious, fake, or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-economic</FONT> volume. In addition, the use of eligible bitcoin spot markets
is designed to mitigate the potential for idiosyncratic market risk, as the failure of any individual bitcoin spot market in and of itself should not materially impact pricing for the Trust. Moreover, any attempt to manipulate the NAV would require
a substantial amount of capital distributed across a majority of the eligible spot markets, and potentially coordinated activity across those markets, making it more difficult to conduct, profit from, or avoid the detection of market manipulation.

Index is designed to represent the U.S. dollar value of one bitcoin every 15 seconds based on VWMP spot market data over rolling sixty-minute increments. The use of rolling sixty-minute increments means a malicious actor would need to sustain
efforts to manipulate the market over an extended period of time, or would need to replicate efforts multiple times, potentially triggering review from the spot market or regulators, or both. The use of a &#147;median&#148; price by its nature
limits the ability of outlier prices that may have been caused by attempts to manipulate the price on a particular market, to impact the NAV, as it systematically excludes those prices from the NAV calculation. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For purposes of calculating the Trust&#146;s NAV per Share, the Trust&#146;s holdings of bitcoin are valued using the same methodology as used
to calculate the Index. The Index is constructed using bitcoin price feeds from eligible spot markets and the VWMP methodology, calculated every 15 seconds based on VWMP market data over rolling sixty-minute increments. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor believes that use of the Index mitigates against idiosyncratic market risk, as the failure of any individual spot market will not
materially impact pricing for the Trust. It also allows the Administrator to calculate the NAV in a manner that significantly deters manipulation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed elsewhere in this Prospectus, the fact that there are multiple bitcoin spot markets contributing prices to the NAV makes
manipulation more difficult in a well-arbitraged and fractured market, as a malicious actor would need to manipulate multiple spot markets simultaneously to impact the NAV, or dramatically skew the historical distribution of volume between the
various markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since the Index is intended to represent the U.S. dollar value of one bitcoin every 15 seconds based on VWMP spot market
data over rolling sixty-minute increments, malicious actors would need to sustain efforts to manipulate the market over an extended period of time, or would need to replicate efforts multiple times across markets, potentially triggering review. This
extended period also supports Authorized Participant activity by capturing volume over a longer time period, rather than forcing Authorized Participants to mark an individual close or auction. The use of a median price eliminates the ability of
outlier prices to impact the NAV, as it systematically excludes those prices from the NAV calculation. The use of a volume-weighted median (as opposed to a traditional median) protects against attempts to manipulate the NAV by executing a large
number of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-dollar</FONT> trades, because any manipulation attempt would have to involve a majority of global spot bitcoin volume in a narrow window to have any influence on the NAV. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Administrator calculates the NAV of the Trust once each Exchange trading day. The NAV for a normal trading day will be released after 4:00
p.m. EST. Trading during the core trading session on the Exchange typically closes at 4:00 p.m. EST. However, NAVs are not officially struck until after 4:00 p.m. EST. The pause after 4:00 p.m. EST provides an opportunity for the Sponsor to
algorithmically detect, flag, investigate, and correct unusual pricing should it occur. The Sponsor has established a Valuation Committee to carry out the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">day-to-day</FONT></FONT>
fair valuation responsibilities and has adopted policies and procedures to govern the fair valuation process and the activities of the Valuation Committee. If the Valuation Committee determines in good faith that the Index does not reflect an
accurate bitcoin price, then the Valuation Committee will instruct the Administrator to employ an alternative method to determine the fair value of the Trust&#146;s assets. In determining an alternative fair value method, the Valuation Committee
generally considers such criteria as observable market-based inputs, including market quotations and last sale information from third-party pricing services and/or trading platforms on which bitcoin are traded. The Valuation Committee&#146;s
selection of third-party pricing services used considers the qualifications, experience, and history of the pricing services and whether their valuation methodologies and procedures are reasonably designed to produce prices that reflect fair value
under the prevailing market conditions. Moreover, the terms of the Trust Agreement do not prohibit the Sponsor from changing the Index or other valuation method used to calculate the net asset value of the Trust. Any such change in the Index or
other valuation method could affect the value of the Shares and investors could suffer a substantial loss on their investment in the Trust. In the event of a material change, the Sponsor will notify Shareholders in a prospectus supplement and/or a
current report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">8-K</FONT> or in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable. </P>

Shareholders and market professionals, a third-party financial data provider will calculate and disseminate throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated intraday indicative value (&#147;IIV&#148;). The IIV will be calculated
based on the Trust&#146;s bitcoin holdings and any other assets expected to comprise that day&#146;s NAV calculation. The third-party financial data provider will use the&nbsp;Blockstream Crypto Data Feed Streaming Level&nbsp;1 as the pricing source
for the spot bitcoin. The Blockstream Crypto Data Feed Streaming Level&nbsp;1 calculates an average of current bitcoin price levels of the bitcoin trading platforms that are available on its feed. The bitcoin trading platforms included in the
Blockstream Crypto Data Feed Streaming Level&nbsp;1 include Bitflyer, Bitfinex, Binance US, Bitso, Bitstamp, BTSE, CEX IO, Exmo, Gemini, ItBit, LMAX Digital and OK Coin. The Trust will provide an IIV per Share updated every 15 seconds, as calculated
by the Exchange or a third-party financial data provider during the Exchange&#146;s regular trading hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. EST (&#147;Regular Trading Hours). The IIV disseminated during Regular Trading Hours should not be viewed as an
actual real-time update of the NAV, which will be calculated only once at the end of each trading day as described herein. The IIV will be widely disseminated on a per Share basis every 15 seconds during Regular Trading Hours through the facilities
of the consolidated tape association (CTA) and Consolidated Quotation System (CQS) high speed lines. In addition, the IIV will be available through <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-line</FONT> information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.

Codification Topic 820, &#147;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&#148; (&#147;ASC Topic 820&#148;) and utilize an exchange-traded price from the Trust&#146;s principal market for bitcoin on the Trust&#146;s financial statement measurement date.
The Sponsor will determine in its sole discretion the valuation sources and policies used to prepare the Trust&#146;s financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Trust intends to engage a third-party vendor to obtain a price from a principal
market for bitcoin, which will be either the market the Trust normally transacts in for bitcoin or, if the Trust does not normally transact in any market or such market suffers an operational interruption and is unavailable, determined and
designated by such third-party vendor daily based on its consideration of several exchange characteristics, including oversight, and the volume and frequency of trades. Under GAAP, such a price is expected to be deemed a Level&nbsp;1 input in
accordance with the ASC Topic 820 because it is expected to be a quoted price in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Sponsor reserves the right to adjust the Share price of the Trust in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for Shareholders. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits. Such splits would decrease

Bitcoin Fund&#148;. The Trust continuously issues shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust that may be purchased and sold on the Exchange. The Trust operates pursuant to an Amended and Restated Trust
Agreement. Delaware Trust Company, a Delaware trust company, is the Delaware trustee of the Trust. The Trust is managed and controlled by the Sponsor. The Sponsor is a limited liability company formed in the state of Delaware on August&nbsp;23,
2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The number of outstanding Shares is expected to increase and decrease from time to time as a result of the creation and redemption
of Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets requires the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of cash represented by the NAV of the Baskets being created or redeemed. The total amount of cash required for the
creation of Baskets will be based on the combined net assets represented by the number of Baskets being created or redeemed. The Sponsor recognizes that the size of the Baskets may impact the effectiveness of the arbitrage mechanism of the
Trust&#146;s creation and redemption process, and accordingly may adjust the size of the Baskets to enhance the activities of the Authorized Participants in the secondary market for the Trust&#146;s Shares. </P>

the Trust represented in bitcoin as calculated using the Index price, less its liabilities (which include estimated accrued but unpaid fees and expenses) represented in bitcoin as calculated using the Index price. The Sponsor Fee is paid by the
Trust to the Sponsor as compensation for services performed under the Trust Agreement. The Administrator calculates the Sponsor Fee in respect of each day by reference to the prior day&#146;s Bitcoin Holdings. The Sponsor Fee is accrued daily in
bitcoin and payable monthly in bitcoin or cash. To the extent there are any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-chain</FONT> transaction fees incurred in connection with the transfers of bitcoin to pay the Sponsor Fee, the Sponsor, and not the
Trust, shall bear such fees. The Sponsor may, at its sole discretion and from time to time, waive all or a portion of the Sponsor Fee for stated periods of time. The Sponsor is under no obligation to waive any portion of its fees and any such waiver

Authorized Participants. The Trust will not bear any costs associated with the transfer or sale of bitcoin to pay the Sponsor Fee. To the extent the Trust incurs any Extraordinary Expenses, the Trust will bear the costs of any transfers or sales of
bitcoin to pay such expenses. The Trust will seek to transfer bitcoin at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they become due. With respect to transfers or sales necessary to pay Trust expenses and liabilities
that are denominated other than in bitcoin, the amount of bitcoin transferred or sold may vary from time to time depending on the actual sales price of bitcoin relative to the Trust&#146;s expenses and liabilities (e.g., if the price of bitcoin
falls, the amount of bitcoin needed to be transferred or sold to pay an expense denominated in U.S. dollars will increase). To the extent the Trust must buy or sell bitcoin, the Trust may do so through a third-party digital asset broker or dealer,
including affiliates of the Sponsor and the Custodian. When the Trust buys or sells bitcoin, the Sponsor seeks quotes from its bitcoin trading counterparties. Such transactions are typically conducted over the counter rather than over a trading
platform or similar order matching service. The Sponsor will select third party brokers or dealers that it believes have implemented adequate anti-money laundering, know-your-customer and other legal compliance policies and procedures. The Sponsor
does not currently contemplate utilizing prime brokerage or similar services in connection with the Trust&#146;s purchases and sales of bitcoin, however it may determine to do so in the future. </P>

in omnibus wallets is held in hot storage for the purpose of satisfying client demands for transfers including in facilitation of redemptions. Within such omnibus hot and cold wallets, the Custodian has represented to the Sponsor that it

is controlled by multi-person controls, multi-team access rules, and multi-factor authentication. The locations of the cold storage sites may change at the discretion of the Custodian and are kept confidential by the Custodian for security purposes.
Transactions from cold to hot storage require physical access, according to the above controls, to one or more cold storage facilities, as well as systematically enforced approvals and integrity verifications, before the secure device can be used to
cryptographically complete the transaction. At no point during this process is the private key removed from the secure device(s) nor the cold storage facility. Once these security processes have been completed, a transfer on the bitcoin network can

participants in a distribution in a manner that would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus- delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. For example, the initial Authorized Participant will be a statutory
underwriter with respect to the initial purchase of Baskets and the Seed Capital Investor will be a statutory underwriter with respect to the Seed Basket. Any purchaser who purchases Shares with a view towards distribution of such Shares may be
deemed to be a statutory underwriter. In addition, an Authorized Participant, other broker-dealer firm or its client will be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases a basket from the Trust, breaks the basket down into the constituent Shares
and sells the Shares to its customers; or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new Shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for the Shares. In contrast, Authorized Participants may engage
in secondary market or other transactions in Shares that would not be deemed &#147;underwriting.&#148; For example, an Authorized Participant may act in the capacity of a broker or dealer with respect to Shares that were previously distributed by
other Authorized Participants. A determination of whether a particular market participant is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular

believes that the ability to create Shares would be reinstated shortly after such determination is made, and any entity desiring to create Shares would be able to do so once the ability to create Shares is reinstated. However, it is possible that
such a determination would cause the Shares to trade at premiums or discounts relative to the Trust&#146;s NAV on the secondary market if arbitrageurs believe that there is risk that the creation and redemption process is not available, as this

communicated by the Sponsor and its agent. A redemption order will be effective on the date it is received by the Transfer Agent (&#147;Redemption Order Date&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. Redemption orders are denominated
and settled in cash (&#147;Cash Redemption Order&#148;). By placing a Cash Redemption Order, an Authorized Participant agrees to facilitate the deposit of Shares with the Transfer Agent. If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate the
foregoing, the order will be cancelled or delayed until the required Shares have been received. An Authorized Participant may not withdraw a redemption order without the prior consent of the Sponsor in its discretion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the case of a Cash Redemption Order, the redemption distribution from the Trust consists of a transfer to the Authorized Participant of an
amount of cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the Trust, net of accrued expenses and other liabilities, on the Redemption Order Date, as the number of Shares to be redeemed under the purchase order is in proportion to the
total number of Shares outstanding on the Redemption Order Date. The redemption distribution due from the Trust will be delivered once the Transfer Agent notifies the Cash Custodian, the Distributor and the Sponsor that the Authorized Participant
has delivered the Shares represented by the Baskets to be redeemed to the Transfer Agent&#146;s DTC account. If the Transfer Agent&#146;s DTC account has not been credited with all of the Shares of the Baskets to be redeemed, the redemption

feasible to process Redemption Orders or for any other reason at any time or from time to time. For example, the Sponsor may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of the Trust&#146;s assets. If
the Sponsor has difficulty liquidating the Trust&#146;s positions, e.g., because of a market disruption event or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">over-the-counter</FONT> contract, it may
be appropriate to suspend creations and redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified. Neither the Distributor, the person authorized to take redemption orders in the manner provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement, nor the
Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement. Any such suspension may cause to price of the Shares to deviate more significantly from the Trust&#146;s NAV per
Share than would be the case if such suspension had not occurred. The Trust will notify Shareholders of any such suspension in a prospectus supplement and/or a current report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">8-K</FONT> or in its annual or

the NAV of the Shares at the time of the offer of the Shares to the public, the supply of and demand for Shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of bitcoin. Baskets are generally redeemed when the price per Share is at a discount to the NAV
per Share. Shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices. An order for one or more Baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf
of multiple clients. Authorized Participants who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets receive no fees, commissions or other forms of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Trust or the Sponsor and no such person has

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following discussion describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences associated with the purchase, ownership and disposition
of Shares by a U.S. Shareholder (as defined below), and certain U.S. federal income consequences that may apply to an investment in Shares by a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-U.S.</FONT> Shareholder (as defined below). The discussion below is
based on the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the date of this Prospectus and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively.
The tax treatment of Shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Except where noted, this discussion only deals with Shares held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment), and does not address special
situations, including those of banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, dealers in securities, currencies, or commodities, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-exempt</FONT>
organizations, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-exempt</FONT> or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-advantaged</FONT> retirement plans or accounts, traders using a

income tax purposes to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the Shares as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement, or persons subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.
Moreover, the discussion below does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law consequences that may apply to an investment in Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisers with respect to all federal,

LLP, although not free from doubt due to the lack of directly governing authority, the Trust should be classified as a &#147;grantor trust&#148; for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and the following discussion assumes such classification). As a
result, the Trust itself should not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, the Trust&#146;s income and expenses should &#147;flow through&#148; to the Shareholders, and the Trustee will report to Shareholders and the IRS on that basis. The
opinion of Dechert LLP is not binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the conclusions of counsel&#146;s opinion and it is possible that the IRS or another tax authority could assert a
position contrary to one or all of those conclusions </P>

and that a court could sustain that contrary position. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee will request a ruling from the IRS with respect to the classification of the Trust for U.S. federal
income tax purposes or with respect to any other matter. If the IRS were to assert successfully that the Trust is not classified as a &#147;grantor trust,&#148; the Trust would likely be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, which may affect the timing and other tax consequences to the Shareholders. Under such circumstances, the Trust might be classified as a publicly traded partnership that would be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, in which case the Trust would be taxed in the same manner as a corporation on its taxable income and distributions to Shareholders out of the earnings and profits of the Trust would be taxed to Shareholders as ordinary dividend income.
However, due to the uncertain treatment of digital currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance in this regard. Except as otherwise indicated, the remainder of this discussion assumes that the Trust is classified as a
grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each Shareholder will be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as if it directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets held
in the Trust. A Shareholder also will be treated as if it directly received its respective pro rata share of the Trust&#146;s income, if any, and as if it directly incurred its respective pro rata share of the Trust&#146;s expenses, subject to some
specialized allocation rules for widely held fixed investment trusts. In the case of a Shareholder that acquires Shares as part of the creation of a Basket in cash, the delivery of cash to the Trust in exchange for a pro rata share of the underlying
bitcoin represented by the Shares and the additional bitcoin purchased with the cash will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder, and the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis and holding period for the Shareholder&#146;s pro rata share of the bitcoin
held in the Trust will be based upon the amount of cash contributed and the date that the Trust purchased the bitcoin with the cash. For purposes of this discussion, and unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that all of a Shareholder&#146;s Shares
are acquired on the same date and at the same price per Share. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares, should consult their own tax advisers as to the determination of the tax
basis and holding period for the underlying bitcoin related to such Shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Current IRS guidance on the treatment of convertible virtual
currencies classifies bitcoin as &#147;property&#148; that is not currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes and clarifies that bitcoin can be held as a capital asset, but it does not address several other aspects of the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of bitcoin. Because bitcoin is a new technological innovation, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of bitcoin or transactions relating to investments in bitcoin may evolve and change from that discussed below, possibly with retroactive
effect. In this regard, the IRS has indicated that it has made it a priority to issue additional guidance related to the taxation of virtual currency transactions, such as transactions involving bitcoin. While the IRS has started to issue such
additional guidance, whether any future guidance will adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in bitcoin or in transactions relating to investments in bitcoin is unknown. Moreover, future developments that may arise
with respect to digital currencies may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital currencies for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust expects to sell or use bitcoin to pay certain expenses of the Trust or to fund cash redemptions if and when applicable. If the Trust
sells bitcoin (for example to generate cash to pay fees or expenses) or is treated as selling bitcoin (for example by using bitcoin to pay fees or expenses), a Shareholder will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference
between (a)&nbsp;the Shareholder&#146;s pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon the sale and (b)&nbsp;the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for its pro rata share of the bitcoin that was sold. A Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for its share
of any bitcoin sold by the Trust will generally be a pro rata portion of the Shareholder&#146;s total tax basis for its share of all of the bitcoin held in the Trust. After any such sale, a Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for its pro rata share of the
bitcoin remaining in the Trust should be equal to its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the bitcoin held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the bitcoin that was sold. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon a Shareholder&#146;s sale of some or all of its Shares, the Shareholder will be treated
as having sold the pro rata share of the bitcoin held in the Trust at the time of the sale that is attributable to the Shares sold. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale in an amount equal to the difference
between (a)&nbsp;the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares, and (b)&nbsp;the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for the pro rata share of the bitcoin held in the Trust at the time of sale that is attributable to the Shares sold, as determined
in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. A selling Shareholder may recognize additional gain or loss when the Trust sells or disposes bitcoin, as described above, attributable to the portion of the year the Shares were held. Based on
current IRS guidance, such gain or loss on the sale of Shares (as well as any gain or loss realized by a Shareholder on account of the Trust selling bitcoin) will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the Shareholder has a holding period of
greater than one year in its pro rata share of the bitcoin that was sold and otherwise will be short-term capital gain or loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sales of
bitcoin to fund cash redemptions are expected to result in gains and losses with such gains and losses expected to be treated as incurred by the Shareholder that is being redeemed. These gains or losses generally would equal the difference between
the amount realized from the sale of the bitcoin and the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for the portion of the Shareholder&#146;s pro rata share of the bitcoin held in the Trust that is sold to fund the redemption, as determined in the manner
described above. A redemption of some or all of a Shareholder&#146;s Shares in exchange for the cash received from such sale is not expected to be treated as a separate taxable event for the Shareholder. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After any sale or redemption of less than all of a Shareholder&#146;s Shares, the Shareholder&#146;s tax basis for its pro rata share of the
bitcoin held in the Trust immediately after such sale or redemption generally will be equal to its tax basis in its share of the total amount of the bitcoin held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale or redemption, less the portion of such
basis which is taken into account in determining the amount of gain or loss recognized by the Shareholder upon such sale or cash redemption or, in the case of an in-kind redemption for bitcoin, that is treated as the basis of the bitcoin received by
the Shareholder in the redemption. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Except for cash temporarily held to pay Trust expenses, to facilitate redemption transactions, or
received in creation transactions, the Trust will only invest in bitcoin. In the event of a fork, the Sponsor will cause the Trust to irrevocably abandon any digital asset resulting from a fork in the Bitcoin network (other than what the Sponsor
determines to be bitcoin). If the Trust were to change this policy, the Trust would need to seek and obtain certain regulatory approvals, including an amendment to the Trust&#146;s registration statement of which this Prospectus is a part and
approval of an application by the Exchange to amend its listing rules. If, despite such abandonment, the Trust were to receive any digital asset resulting from a fork in the Bitcoin network (other than what the Sponsor determines to be bitcoin), the
Trust Agreement requires the Sponsor to cause the forked asset to be sold and have the proceeds distributed to the Shareholders. The sale of a forked asset received by the Trust will give rise to gain or loss, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
if the amount realized on the sale differs from the value of the new forked asset at the time it was received by the Trust. A hard fork may therefore give rise to additional tax liabilities for Shareholders. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain U.S. Shareholders, who are individuals, are required to pay a 3.8% tax on the lesser of the excess of their modified adjusted gross

addition to any capital gains taxes due on such investment income. A similar tax applies to estates and trusts. U.S. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, this tax may have on their investment in the

above), even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata shares of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly
incurred the expense. However, most trust expenses are expected to result in miscellaneous itemized deductions, and noncorporate taxpayers generally are not allowed any deduction with respect to miscellaneous itemized deductions for tax years
beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2025, noncorporate taxpayers may deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent they exceed in the aggregate 2% of the
