summary
The investing industry has arrived at an historic 
moment: the introduction of spot bitcoin exchange-
traded funds in the U.S. This development 
has enabled increased mainstream access to 
bitcoin, a notable evolution from its beginnings 
as a niche internet-native form of money. In this paper, we explore the significant shifts in 
investor interest, industry infrastructure, and the 
regulatory environment that have brought us to this 
moment, and the implications ahead for investors.
Key takeaways	
• The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. represents a scalable
bridge from traditional finance into bitcoin, helping to broaden access
to bitcoin for mainstream investors.  • Bitcoin’s characteristics as a store of value and its potential to
reimagine payment methods, even while exhibiting volatility, have helped it become the most widely adopted cryptoasset and the first
form of internet-native money to gain broad global adoption. • Three shifts have taken place to create the conditions for this moment:
1	 Global forces have accelerated interest
2	 Bitcoin’s ecosystem infrastructure has developed
3 The regulatory atmosphere has evolved as policymakers in 
numerous jurisdictions enact or consider regulatory and 
other policy changes to more directly address aspects of the 
digital asset ecosystem.  • These shifts have helped enable the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in the
U.S. We believe that for many investor types, the ETF could represent
the preferred holding vehicle for bitcoin and this launch represents a
new era that will be characterized by more choice and convenience.  • Bitcoin’s exact path is unknown, but we believe this enhanced access,
catalyzed by the convenience of U.S. ETFs, may further boost bitcoin’s
adoption as a potential store of value by a wider investing audience.  3

Bitcoin’s story has been one of innovation and 
growth. The world’s leading cryptoasset has been 
on a journey since its launch 15 years ago, rising 
in terms of access, use cases, and market value, 
to become the most widely adopted digital asset, 
holding over 50% of the $1.7 trillion market.1
Now, with the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded 
funds in the U.S., mainstream access across more 
investor archetypes is opening up to an asset that was 
once considered a niche financial technology.

We believe 
that these increased access points via the convenience 
and utility of ETFs give more choice to investors, and, 
potentially, bolster bitcoin’s place in the future financial 
system as an alternative store of value.
Bitcoin has been culturally relevant for years, giving rise 
to memes and attracting, at first, a fringe investor base, 
often made up of younger adopters, who are comfortable 
transacting their lives in an increasingly digital way. The 
world’s population, in many parts, is skewing younger, 
and the Millennial and Gen Z generations are now an 
increasingly significant part of the workforce and more 
predominant in the investing world, as both self-directed 
and institutional investors.2 As investors and adopters, 
they are increasingly interested in bitcoin.  At the same time, there has been an acceleration 
of growth in the digital asset ecosystem, leading to 
more adoption by a broader group of investors. This 
widening group includes institutional investors.
1 CoinGecko, as of Dec. 31, 2023. Bitcoin predominance based on its market cap of $860 billion, which accounts for 51% of the $1.7 trillion total market cap of all cryptoassets, 
excluding stablecoins. 2 United Nations report “World Population Prospects 2022,” July 2022; CFA Institute report “Gen Z and Investing: Social Media, Crypto, FOMO, and 
Family,” May 2023. Introduction
4 MKTGM0724A/S-3748543-4/27 The industry now stands at this historic moment. Access 
to bitcoin is broadening through the introduction of 
spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which 
are helping to bridge traditional finance with bitcoin.  This is quite an evolution from bitcoin’s beginnings as 
a niche technology. But how did we get to this point?  What has changed in bitcoin and the traditional finance 
world to enable access to bitcoin in the ETF wrapper? 
And what does this mean for bitcoin and investors? 


None of this has happened by accident. We believe 
three shifts have combined to create the conditions
for spot bitcoin ETFs to launch: 
1.	 Global forces that have accelerated investor interest
2.	 The development of ecosystem infrastructure
3.	 Evolution in the regulatory atmosphere In this paper, we will discuss these shifts, bitcoin’s 
journey as an asset, what a new era of access, 
choice, and convenience could mean for investors, 
and what unique bitcoin attributes to consider 
for those weighing portfolio allocation.

Understanding 
bitcoin’s 
breakthrough
Before considering what the future may hold for bitcoin, it’s important to 
first understand its significance. The idea of digital money has been around 
for decades; it was a known, missing component of early internet browsers.  The internet provided information connectivity, but what was missing was 
payments. Previous attempts to create digital money lacked community 
adoption, were ahead of their time, or didn’t have the right architecture.
When bitcoin was launched on Jan. 3, 2009, it represented a confluence of decades 
of research in ideas across computer science, cryptography, and peer-to-peer 
networks.

The resulting breakthrough was the first successful implementation 
of a decentralized digital asset in which transactions can be conducted directly 
between two parties without the need for an intermediary, anywhere in the world.  As such, bitcoin brought forth for the first time an asset that was digitally 
native, global, scarce, decentralized, and resistant to censorship. Since then, 
several factors have driven the adoption of bitcoin, including its characteristics 
as a store of value, and its potential to reimagine payment systems for a 
global audience, even while it has exhibited volatility. The properties enabled 
by bitcoin are notable in the context of certain long-standing challenges 
(many centuries-old) that money and payment systems have faced. 6
MKTGM0724A/S-3748543-6/27
Transacting across 
jurisdictions The evolution of money reflects progressively more efficient mediums of exchange 
with which to transact. Today, the world’s domestic payment systems are increasingly 
digital and efficient; yet the challenges of transacting across borders – the bridging 
of different currencies and banking networks – remain substantial. Users of today’s 
system still incur significant frictions, cost, and time delays to move money. Meanwhile, bitcoin and its blockchain-based framework brought forth 
for the first time the possibility of a global “internet of value,” where 
assets can be moved frictionlessly at low cost, in near real-time. Fixed supply not 
subject to inflation
Government-issued fiat currencies have become the de facto global standard 
on which the world’s monetary system runs. While this type of money has many 
advantages, including its ability to handle immense transaction volumes at speed 
and scale , it comes with the drawback that its supply can be arbitrarily increased.  Throughout history, when fiscal challenges arise, governments have often used 
this flexibility to increase the supply of money as a more palatable alternative 
to directly raising taxes on the population. But this “indirect taxation” can carry 
a significant economic cost to savers to the extent it produces inflation. Bitcoin’s technological design enables its maximum supply to be fixed in its 
code at 21 million units, of which 19.6 million are already circulating.3  
3 Bitcoin White Paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” (2008), and CoinGecko, as of June 2023. Forward looking 
estimates may not come to pass. There is no guarantee that the current 21 million supply cap for outstanding bitcoin, which is estimated 
to be reached by approximately the year 2140, will not be changed. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  7
MKTGM0724A/S-3748543-7/27
An open access 
financial system
Bitcoin is available to anyone with a mobile phone and an internet connection. Its 
open access nature means that bitcoin can help enable more people to participate 
in the global financial system who may not have full access to traditional banking 
networks, or who are limited by their own country-specific infrastructure.

This is 
important as there are approximately 1.4 billion people globally who do not have 
access to a bank account, despite there being a larger number of phones than 
people in the world.5
For citizens of countries with authoritarian regimes or perennially unstable 
currencies, access to a global, permissionless monetary network can 
represent a critical protector of economic freedom and independence. 4 Boston Consulting Group (“What does the future hold for crypto exchanges”), as of July 2022. The report estimates there are 400 million crypto users 
worldwide, measured by analyzing on-chain data from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains assuming all on-chain users own some crypto. 5 World Bank, 
Global Findex Database, 2021. Worldwide account ownership was 76% in 2021, leaving 24% of the world’s adults, or 1.4 billion, without access to accounts 
at banks or other financial institutions; Statista (with data from International Telecommunication Union, World Bank, UN Population Division), April 3, 2023, 
reports there were an estimated 8.59 billion cellular phone subscriptions worldwide in 2022, and the population was estimated at 7.95 billion. While scarcity of a particular asset on its own is meaningless, the network 
effects from bitcoin having gained significant adoption as the clear 
preeminent cryptoasset make its scarcity relevant – analogous to how 
gold commands a monetary premium in ways other metals do not.4
8 MKTGM0724A/S-3748543-8/27 How we 
got to this 
moment A new era of access to bitcoin through 
ETFs is now unfolding. In our view, 
three significant shifts have taken place 
to create the conditions for this moment.  9
MKTGM0724A/S-3748543-9/27
Rise in global inflation: Central banks around the 
globe responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by using 
monetary stimulus to cushion the economic shock.  This increase in the money supply, combined with 
fiscal stimulus and supply-side pressures, 
contributed to a spike in inflation across much of the 
world, to levels not seen since the 1980s. Bitcoin’s 
rigid monetary supply, against this backdrop, 
became viewed as a haven to a larger number of 
investors, and its price surged 10-fold from April 
2020 to November 2021, where it reached an all-
time high of over $67,000.6
Geopolitical uncertainty: Globalization is being 
rewired as the world splits into competing blocs, 
and wars continue in Europe and the Middle East. In recent history, bitcoin has tended to appreciate 
when geopolitical disorder rises because it is viewed 
as an asset insulated from country-specific risks.7 
Banking and fiscal concerns: In March 2023, the 
U.S. regional banking crisis saw a period of 
concerns over the soundness of the U.S. banking 
system. Bitcoin exists outside the system, and its 
price jumped 29% during that crisis.8 Later in 
2023, renewed focus on the U.S.’s fiscal situation, 
amplified, separately, by the return of debt ceiling 
negotiations, caused increasing focus on bitcoin as 
an asset whose value tends to move inversely to the 
U.S. dollar.9  Future of finance: The future of finance 
represents a fast-evolving financial architecture 
that is changing how households and companies 
use cash, borrow, transact, and seek returns.

Additionally, digital disruption is heightening 
interest in digital assets and creating new use 
cases across industries.
Demographic divergence: Younger populations 
and the middle class are expanding in selected 
emerging economies around the world. Younger people are more likely to be considered ‘digital 
natives’ (that they grew up with the internet) and 
their lives are more virtual than older generations.  They live with frictionless, instantaneous 
technology and global communication, but money 
as a technology has been a laggard. Millennial and 
Gen Z investors are now more likely to own crypto 
than mutual funds, equities, or ETFs.10
6 Bloomberg Bitcoin Spot Price: Bitcoin traded at $6,351 in April 2020 and rose to $67,734 in November 2021. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  7 Bloomberg Bitcoin Spot Price: Bitcoin’s price appreciated 28% one month after US tension with Iran, from Jan. 3, 2020 to Feb. 3, 2020. Bitcoin’s price appreciated 15% in the 
month after the Ukraine war began, from Feb. 2, 2022 to March 2, 2022. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 8 Bloomberg Bitcoin Spot Price: Bitcoin’s price 
rose 29% from $22,006 on March 8, 2023, to $28,395 on March 30. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 9 Based on Bloomberg Spot Price DXY and BTC: 
Bitcoin has had a correlation of -0.19 on average over the last three years (Jan. 2020-Jan. 2 2024). 10 CFA Institute report “Gen Z and Investing: Social Media, Crypto, FOMO, 
and Family,” May 2023. Global forces 
accelerate interest 1 2 3 As the world changes, particularly in the post-COVID-19 era, we 
believe several global, interrelated, long-term trends, or mega forces, 
have been and will continue to elevate bitcoin’s appeal and drive this 
accelerated adoption.  10

11 Messari State of Crypto Fundraising Report, Oct. 2023. 12 Coinbase Public Filings, as of Sept. 30, 2023. Coinbase is the world’s largest publicly traded crypto firm with 
$114B in assets on the platform. Reference to individual companies mentioned in this communication is for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as 
investment advice or investment recommendation.  Development 
of ecosystem 
infrastructure As interest in bitcoin has expanded, the ecosystem infrastructure and 
nature of service providers has evolved to create industry practices 
and standards that helped enable many institutions to participate at 
scale.

This transformation has been catalyzed in part by the entrance of 
institutional investors. Venture capital: There has been significant investment in crypto, and digital 
assets more broadly, with over $30 billion in venture capital flowing into the 
ecosystem in both 2021 and 2022.11 Funding has been shifting away from 
user-facing applications and toward crypto infrastructure.11 Alongside this 
has come an inflow of human capital as experienced leaders from traditional 
finance and technology have joined the industry in large numbers.  Trading: Bitcoin trading infrastructure has improved significantly to better 
meet the needs of institutional players. This includes the development of 
prime brokerage solutions, advanced algorithmic trading strategies, and other 
operational tools which have enhanced liquidity and quality of execution. For 
example, Coinbase, founded in 2012, has become the largest publicly traded 
crypto company in the world, with a broad range of service offerings across 
institutionally critical functions such as trading, prime brokerage, and custody.12
Custody: The funding and infrastructure improvements have helped bolster 
custody, transparency, and security – critical infrastructure given the 
unique security challenges associated with digitally native bearer assets.  There has been a proliferation in the number of dedicated institutional 
“cold” storage custody platforms, in which bitcoin is kept offline and 
maximally safe. Several of the world’s largest traditional custodians have 
or are developing their own bitcoin custody capabilities. Additionally, 
auditing firms are now able to provide proper institutional oversight.  1

13 China, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia have bans on trading cryptoassets. India’s banking system prohibited its financial services entities from facilitating the sale and purchase of 
cryptocurrencies in 2018, but the country’s Supreme Court ruled the prohibition was unconstitutional in 2020. PricewaterhouseCoopers report “PwC Global Crypto Regulation 
Report” published Dec. 19, 2022. 14 Associated Press article “Crypto rules get final approval to make Europe a global leader on regulation,” May 16, 2023, European Parliament 
Briefing: “Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)”, Sept. 9, 2023. Regulatory 
evolution As investor interest increased and infrastructure evolved, policymakers began assessing their 
existing financial regulatory frameworks to determine whether they provided adequate oversight 
of digital assets to ensure robust market participant protections while also allowing for growth and 
development of the asset class. This assessment, which has gained momentum in recent years, 
has led some jurisdictions to develop new or modified regulatory frameworks for digital assets to 
address the unique way the assets are issued, custodied, and traded.  Earlier in bitcoin’s journey there were attempts to ban digital assets such as 
bitcoin in certain countries.13 But by and large, regulators and governments 
have recognized that bitcoin and digital assets represent a technology 
innovation that is likely here to stay, and that need effective regulation to 
protect investors and markets. This shift in thinking has prompted some 
regulatory evolution, notably in the European Union and in certain U.S. states.  Despite the progress and direction of travel, the process of establishing a full 
regulatory framework remains a work-in-progress.

Countries are focused on 
how to create new, and or tailor existing, regulatory frameworks, just as they 
do for other parts of the financial system and other emerging technologies. 
•		
The European Union will become the first major jurisdiction with
a comprehensive crypto framework, the Markets in Cryptoassets
(MiCA) licensing regime, when it takes effect at year-end 2024.14
•		
In the U.S., the BitLicense implemented by the state of New York
and overseen by the New York State Department of Financial
Services has become an important regulatory baseline for many
companies operating in this space. At the federal level, there have 
been efforts in Congress on a bipartisan basis to create measures 
aimed at regulating and providing greater market structure to the 
digital asset industry, though none have been enacted as yet.  •		
Regulation is encouraging development of digital assets infrastructure
in places such as Singapore, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, and
Hong Kong.  Addressing illicit finance concerns related to bitcoin is a critical focus 
of both regulators and digital asset market participants. While bitcoin is a 
notably imperfect vehicle for illicit actors because of the public nature of the 
digital transaction history the blockchain leaves, it is still used in various 
contexts for certain types of illicit activity today. While digital assets are already 
subject to anti-money laundering restrictions, as adoption grows we expect that 
regulators, law enforcement, and the industry will work together to effectively 
deploy additional capabilities enabled by blockchain analytics so that it will 
become progressively more difficult to use crypto for illicit activities.  1

Bitcoin’s 
uneven 
journey  Throughout bitcoin’s journey, its value has increased over extended time horizons 
– even as its volatility garnered headlines. In all, bitcoin has experienced four major
price cycles. Corrections from cycle peaks have typically been severe, and yet in
each cycle the trough at its conclusion has been higher than the prior cycle’s peak.
Looking at the past 10 years, bitcoin has exhibited annualized returns of 124%, 
with a disproportionate number of extreme positive return periods, where large price 
increases significantly outweighed price drawdowns.15 Bitcoin has outperformed 
all major asset classes on an annualized return basis over the last 10 years, despite 
three significant bear markets, while gold has annualized returns of 2% over the 
same period.16 Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on 
current market conditions. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk 
of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.  15 Bloomberg, BlackRock calculations as of Jan. 2, 2024. Bitcoin returns and drawdowns calculated using Bloomberg Bitcoin Spot Price. Past performance does not 
guarantee future results. 16 See page 17 for more information.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. As illustrated by Bloomberg Spot Bitcoin Prices and BlackRock calculations, there have been four price cycles in bitcoin’s history. Bitcoin 
price cycle is defined as a period in which the price of bitcoin reached a new all-time high and was followed by a correction ending at its max drawdown. 1 The Inception date of this analysis is July 
18, 2010, which is the date the bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox launched. Sources: CoinDesk, Bloomberg, as of Dec. 31, 2023. Note: dollar values shown are USD.

 Bitcoin ETFs
 usher in new 
era of access
Shifting from niche adopters to a global scale, bitcoin has arrived at this moment of 
expanded access through the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. We believe that 
for many investor types, the ETF could represent the preferred holding vehicle for 
bitcoin, and that this era will be characterized by more access, choice, and convenience, 
all of which may benefit investors.
20
MKTGM0724A/S-3748543-20/27
Access: The introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs expands investor access due to the very 
nature of these investment vehicles. In their 30-year history, ETFs have emerged as a 
trusted technology to provide investors efficient access in one standard wrapper to all 
kind of markets, asset classes, and regions. ETFs enable choice and they are 
transparent. Spot bitcoin ETFs, in particular, can make bitcoin more accessible by 
helping to reduce the complexities and operational burdens involved in owning bitcoin 
outright, including managing custody and often complex tax dynamics. ETFs also 
mean more types of accounts can hold the investment, from individual retirement 
brokerages to large institutional accounts. The broader availability of spot bitcoin ETFs 
means investors may be able to see bitcoin integrated into their holdings. This is 
important because investors are increasingly seeking whole portfolio solutions to view 
their asset allocations and risk holistically.  
Transparency & Liquidity:

ETFs, over time, have historically improved markets by 
increasing price transparency to the underlying asset classes and adding a new 
avenue of liquidity through the trading of ETFs on traditional exchanges. In this way, 
ETFs, in our view, may help expand the bitcoin trading ecosystem by bringing in a new 
liquidity dimension. ETFs may also act as “shock absorbers” during volatile trading 
sessions as buyers and sellers transact on the exchange, at real-time prices, without 
having to trade the underlying assets. We believe this expanded access through ETFs may be meaningful in the evolution of 
bitcoin and may further solidify its dominance vis-à-vis the rest of the crypto space.  Unique Attributes: The combination of access, transparency, and liquidity via ETFs 
may prompt more investors to evaluate bitcoin as a prospective investment. We believe 
allocation decisions, including whether to invest at all and in what proportion, will vary 
widely across investors and investor archetypes based on individual preferences and 
circumstances.
We expect many investors will take attributes such as volatility, correlation, and 
skewness into portfolio allocation considerations:
•		
Volatility: Bitcoin has seen significant fluctuation in its price levels. From
2016 to 2023, bitcoin’s one-year trailing price volatility ranged from 41% to
109%.17 Its price volatility still remains elevated compared with other assets but
has tended to decline gradually over time as its value has increased, with volatility
halving from over 85% at the end of 2018 to 44% at year-end 2023.18
•		
Correlation: Bitcoin’s correlation has varied over time from negative values to
strong positive values depending on which macro forces are most active in driving
asset prices. On a long-term average basis, bitcoin has maintained a low
correlation to equities, similar to that of gold, with an average correlation of 0.2
since 2015.19
•		
Skewness: Bitcoin has historically exhibited significant asymmetric returns, or
positive skewness. Over the last decade, bitcoin’s returns exceeded 30% in 21
months, far exceeding the six months when bitcoin prices fell by more than 30%.19
For comparison, monthly returns of the S&P 500 only exceeded 10% twice in the
last decade.17 There is no guarantee that this trend will continue.  17 Bloomberg, BlackRock calculations, as of Dec. 31, 2023, taking percent daily change in Bloomberg Bitcoin Spot Price and calculating the one-year trailing standard deviation, 
which is the annualized volatility of the fund’s monthly net asset value (NAV) total returns over a specific time period. 18 S&P Global data as of Dec. 21, 2023: Bloomberg Bitcoin Spot 
Price volatility compares with the volatility of the S&P 500 (volatility less than 16% in 2023), and SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), which had volatility of 13% over the same period.

Conclusion
Bitcoin’s journey may be just beginning. Uniquely amongst cryptoassets, 
the infrastructure and investor recognition around bitcoin is now in place to 
support bitcoin on a broader scale following significant shifts in recent years, 
coinciding with the opening of mainstream access to this asset. Major forces 
are boosting adoption, from increasing geopolitical tension to the rise of digital 
natives. Now this new era is widening mainstream access to bitcoin via ETFs. Although the exact path bitcoin takes is unknown, we believe this enhanced 
access, catalyzed by the convenience of ETFs, may further boost bitcoin’s 
adoption as a potential store of value by a wider investing audience.  Contributors:

Glossary

Bitcoin: Can refer to both the asset and the network protocol. • The protocol, Bitcoin, processes transactions and maintains the ledger via a distributed system of computers and nodes. • The asset, bitcoin, is the native token on the Bitcoin network and the world’s leading and most widely adopted cryptoasset. It is mined, stored, and transferred on a peer-to-peer network via a public ledger, the blockchain.  Blockchain: A distributed digital database that is shared amongst the nodes of a network of computers that enables consensus.  As a database, a blockchain stores information, maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The core innovation 
of blockchain technology is focused on the fidelity and security of a record of data while minimizing trust amongst participants.  Cryptoassets, or cryptocurrencies, or crypto: These are considered digitally native assets because they are issued on a blockchain. What makes them unique is that they utilize cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and a public ledger that is amended via consensus 
to regulate the generation of new units, verify the transactions, and secure the records of ownership without reliance on an intermediary.  Digital assets:  An umbrella term that refers primarily to cryptoassets, stablecoins, and financial assets issued as tokens on a blockchain.

Stablecoin: A stablecoin is a cryptoasset pegged to a stable source of value, typically a currency or commodity. 24
