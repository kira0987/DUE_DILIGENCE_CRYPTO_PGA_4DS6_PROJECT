Overview
Opinions
U.S. Supreme CourtSEC v. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293
(1946)Securities and Exchange Commission
v. Howey Co.No. 843Argued May 2, 1946Decided May 27, 1946328 U.S. 293Syllabus1. Upon the facts of this case, an offering of units of a citrus
grove development, coupled with a contract for cultivating,
marketing, and remitting the net proceeds to the investor, was an
offering of an "investment contract" within the meaning of that
term as used in the provision of ยง 2(1) of the Securities Act of
1933 defining "security" as including any "investment contract,"
and was therefore subject to the registration requirements of the
Act. Pp.328 U. S.
294-297,328 U. S.
299.2. For purposes of the Securities Act, an investment contract
(undefined by the Act) means a contract, transaction, or scheme
whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is
led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a
third party, it being immaterial whether the shares in the
enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal
interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise. Pp.328 U. S.
298-299.3. The fact that some purchasers, by declining to enter into the
service contract, chose not to accept the offer of the investment
contract in its entirety does not require a different result, since
the Securities Act prohibits the offer, as well as the sale, of
unregistered nonexempt securities. P.328 U. S.
300.4. The test of whether there is an "investment contract" under
the Securities Act is whether the scheme involves an investment of
money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the
efforts of others; and, if that test be satisfied, it is immaterial
whether the enterprise is speculative or nonspeculative, or whether
there is a sale of property with or without intrinsic value. P.328 U. S.
301.5. The policy of the Securities Act of affording broad
protection to investors is not to be thwarted by unrealistic and
irrelevant formulae. P.328 U. S.
