Does CoinMarketCap.com List All Cryptocurrencies?
Almost. We have a process that we use to verify assets. Once verified, we create a coin description pagelike this.

As mentioned above, we have adue diligence processthat we apply to new coins before they are listed. This process controls how many of the cryptocurrencies from the global market are represented on our site.
What Is an Altcoin?
The very first cryptocurrency wasBitcoin. Since it is open source, it is possible for other people to use the majority of the code, make a few changes and then launch their own separate currency. Many people have done exactly this. Some of these coins are very similar to Bitcoin, with just one or two amended features (such asLitecoin), while others are very different, with varying models of security, issuance and governance. However, they all share the same moniker ‚Äî every coin issued after Bitcoin is considered to be an altcoin.
What Is a Smart Contract?
The first chain to launchsmart contractswasEthereum. A smart contract enables multiple scripts to engage with each other using clearly defined rules, to execute on tasks which can become a coded form of a contract. They have revolutionized the digital asset space because they have enabled decentralized exchanges, decentralized finance, ICOs, IDOs and much more. A huge proportion of the value created and stored in cryptocurrency is enabled by smart contracts.
What Is a Stablecoin?
Price volatility has long been one of the features of the cryptocurrency market. When asset prices move quickly in either direction and the market itself is relatively thin, it can sometimes be difficult to conduct transactions as might be needed. To overcome this problem, a new type of cryptocurrency tied in value to existing currencies ‚Äî ranging from the U.S. dollar, other fiats or even other cryptocurrencies ‚Äî arose. These new cryptocurrency are known asstablecoins, and they can be used for a multitude of purposes due to their stability.
What Is an NFT?
NFTs are multi-use images that are stored on a blockchain. They can be used as art, a way to share QR codes, ticketing and many more things. The first breakout use was for art, with projects likeCryptoPunksandBored Ape Yacht Clubgaining large followings. We also list all of thetop NFT collectionsavailable, including the relatedNFT coinsand tokens.. We collect latest sale and transaction data, plusupcoming NFT collection launchesonchain. NFTs are a new and innovative part of the crypto ecosystem that have the potential to change and update many business models for theWeb 3world.
What Are In-game Tokens?
Play-to-earn(P2E) games, also known asGameFi, has emerged as an extremely popular category in the crypto space. It combinesnon-fungible tokens(NFT), in-game crypto tokens,decentralized finance(DeFi) elements and sometimes even metaverse applications. Players have an opportunity to generate revenue by giving their time (and sometimes capital) and playing these games.
One of the biggest winners isAxie Infinity‚Äî a Pok√©mon-inspired game where players collect Axies (NFTs of digital pets), breed and battle them against other players to earn Smooth Love Potion (SLP) ‚Äî the in-game reward token. This game was extremely popular in developing countries like The Philippines, due to the level of income they could earn. Players in the Philippines can check the price ofSLP to PHP todaydirectly on CoinMarketCap.
