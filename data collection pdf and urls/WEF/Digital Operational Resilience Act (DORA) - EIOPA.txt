Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)
Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)
TheDigital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)is a EU regulation that entered into force on 16 January 2023 and will apply as of 17 January 2025.
It aims at strengthening the IT security of financial entities such as banks, insurance companies and investment firms and making sure that the financial sector in Europe is able to stay resilient in the event of a severe operational disruption.
DORA brings harmonisation of the rules relating to operational resilience for the financial sector applying to 20 different types of financial entities and ICT third-party service providers.
Why is DORA needed?
The financial sector is increasingly dependent on technology and on tech companies to deliver financial services. This makes financial entities vulnerable to cyber-attacks or incidents.
When not managed properly, ICT risks can lead to disruptions of financial services offered across borders. This in turn, can have an impact on other companies, sectors and even on the rest of the economy, which underlines the importance of the digital operational resilience of the financial sector.
This is where the Digital Operational Resilience Act, or DORA, comes into play.
