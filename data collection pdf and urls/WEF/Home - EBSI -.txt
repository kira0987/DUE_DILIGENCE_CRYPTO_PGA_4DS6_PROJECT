Introducing EBSI
TheEuropean Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)was born in 2018 when29 countries(all EU members states, Norway and Liechtenstein) and theEU Commissionjoined forces to create theEuropean Blockchain Partnership (EBP).
The EBP’s vision is to leverage blockchain to create cross-border services for public administrations, businesses, citizens and their ecosystems to verify information and make services trustworthy. As EBSI continues to evolve, so does its governance. The EUROPEUM-EDIC, a new legal entity, is currently in the process of taking over EBSI's governance and preparing it to go into production.
Discover and understand EBSI by having a look at our website and visiting theFAQs.

EBSI Architecture
Since 2018, the European Commission (EC) and the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) have been building the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI). The EBP and the EC develop and deploy EBSI througha network of distributed nodesacross Europe to support cross-border applications such as Track and Trace,Verifiable Credentials, Trusted Data Exchange and IP management across multiple domains.So far, the EBP has supported the developer of use cases in key domains such as SME Financing, Document Traceability, Self-sovereign Identity, Social Security, Diploma, Asylum Process Management and Trusted Data Sharing.
Explore the What is EBSI pageand learn more about EBSI’s network, infrastructure and capabilities.
What is EBSI?
What can you do with EBSI
EBSI’s capabilities are categorised into different families: Verifiable Credentials, Trusted Data Exchange and Track and Trace.  Each family is divided into subdomains that you can discover below.
Digital wallets
Wallets are applications that let you interact with the EBSI ecosystem. 
It is a tool to let you manage your account and all your documents on the network. With your EBSI conformant wallet, you are able to store, verify and share information across Europe.

EBSI FAQ
What is the European Blockchain Partnership?
The European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) was created in April 2018 by a Joint Declaration and includes all EU Member States and members of the European Economic Area (Norway and Liechtenstein). The signatories of this Joint Declaration commit to working together towards realising the potential of blockchain-based services for the benefit of citizens, society and the economy. As part of this commitment, the Partnership is building a European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI), which will deliver EU-wide cross-border public services using blockchain technology. In 2020, EBSI will deploy a network of distributed blockchain nodes across Europe, supporting applications focused on selected use-cases.
Why Blockchain and EBSI?
As we build the European regulatory framework, in the transition from paper to digital, a key question arises: how to share official documents, called ‘evidences’ or ‘credentials’ in a way that can be trusted?

Blockchain changes the traditional pattern of data sharing due to its distributed nature, as opposed to a centralised information exchange protocol. Blockchain can act as a point of truth that supports the verification of the entities involved in the transaction and the authenticity of information without requiring real-time access to the source of the information.

EBSI's objective is leveraging on blockchain to accelerate the creation of cross-border services for public administrations and their ecosystems to verify information and to make services more trustworthy.
What is the technology behind EBSI?
The European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) is a network of distributed blockchain nodes across Europe. It is the first EU-wide blockchain infrastructure, driven by the public sector, in full respect of European values and regulations.

The EBSI nodes composing the network support multiple protocols (pluggable protocols) and a full set of APIs. The main protocols supported at the moment are Hyperledger Besu (with IBFT 2.0 consensus) and Fabric.
