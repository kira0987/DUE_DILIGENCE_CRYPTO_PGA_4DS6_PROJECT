The International Comparative Legal Guides and the International Business Reports are published by: Global Legal Group
The ‘Data Protection 2015’ guide is very practical and easy to use. The level of information contained within the guide is clear and appropriate legislation references allow for the user to make an easier in-depth analysis where appropriate. The guide has proved to be an excellent resource for an in-house legal team covering multiple jurisdictions.Tanya Daniels, Head of EU Data Protection - Quintiles
