Under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571) (SFO) and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap. 615) (AMLO), centralised virtual asset trading platforms carrying on their businesses in Hong Kong, or actively marketing their services to Hong Kong investors, are required to be licensed and regulated by the SFC.

Licensing scope
Centralised platforms providing trading services in security tokens* using an automated trading engine which matches client orders and also providing custody services as an ancillary service to their trading services

* Given that the terms and features of a virtual asset may evolve over time, a virtual asset's classification may change from a non-security token to a security token (or vice versa). To avoid contravention of the licensing regimes and to ensure business continuity, it would be appropriate for virtual asset trading platforms to apply for licences under both the SFO and AMLO regimes.
How to apply
Please submit the licensing application to the SFC throughWINGS. Please refer to theuser guidesandonline demoof WINGS on the SFC's website on how to open a WINGS account and how to prepare an application on WINGS.
To streamline the application process, applicants for licences under both the SFO and AMLO regimes can submit a single consolidated application online and indicate that they are applying for both licences simultaneously.
Application documents
Please submit to the SFC:
Application forms
(1) Copies of the VATP applicant’s written policies and procedures, (2) documentation to show that a suitable EA has been identified to perform an external assessment for the VATP applicant and (3) the capability statement of the EA, in the application bundle.
