Regulatory Sandbox
Overview of Regulatory Sandbox
The FinTech Regulatory Sandbox framework enables financial institutions and FinTech players to experiment with innovative financial products or services in a live environment but within a well-defined space and duration.
Depending on the experiment, MAS will provide appropriate regulatory support by relaxing specific legal and regulatory requirements prescribed by MAS, which the sandbox entity will otherwise be subject to, for the duration of the sandbox.
The sandbox will include appropriate safeguards to contain the consequences of failure and maintain the overall safety and soundness of the financial system.
Upon successful experimentation and on exiting the sandbox, the sandbox entity must fully comply with the relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
Please refer to theFAQs(169.5 KB)andInfographics(192.9 KB)on MAS FinTech Regulatory Sandbox framework. If you have further questions, please approach your MAS Review Officer, or emailfintech_sandbox@mas.gov.sg.
Note:
Applicants seeking to provide digital advisory services should refer to MAS’ regulatory framework for digital advisers which is set out in theGuidelines on Provision of Digital Advisory Services. The regulatory sandbox will not be applicable for such applicants.
Sandbox Options
Sandbox
For more complex business models where customisation is required to balance the risks and benefits of the experiment.
Sandbox Express
Fast-track approvals for activities where the risks are low and well understood by the market. Rely on disclosures and pre-determined rules.
Sandbox Plus
One-stop assistance in areas of regulatory support and financial grant.
