Markets In Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA)
Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA)
The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) institutes uniform EU market rules for crypto-assets. The regulation covers crypto-assets that are not currently regulated by existing financial services legislation. Key provisions for those issuing and trading crypto-assets (including asset-reference tokens and e-money tokens) cover transparency, disclosure, authorisation and supervision of transactions. The new legal framework will support market integrity and financial stability by regulating public offers of crypto-assets and by ensuring consumers are better informed about their associated risks.
MiCA Implementing Measures
The Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) entered into force in June 2023. The regulation includes a substantial number of Level 2 and Level 3 measures that must be developed before the entry into application of the new regime (within a 12-to-18-month deadline depending on the mandate).
During the implementation phase of MiCA, ESMA (in close cooperation with EBA, EIOPA, and the ECB) is consulting with the public on a range of technical standards that will be published sequentially in three packages. The aim is to deliver draft level 2 and 3 measures that incorporate feedback from the public as soon as possible. The date for the entry into application of the measures is subject to their adoption by the European Commission and approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.
Overview of MiCA Consultation Process
ESMA is releasing the MiCA consultation packages in sequence starting with the Level 2 and Level 3 measures with the shortest deadlines. These include those related to authorisation, governance, conflicts of interest, and complaint handling procedures.
The first package will be launched in July 2023. ESMA plans to publish the second package by October 2023. The third and final consultation package, which includes the MiCA mandates with an 18-month deadline, will be published (tentatively) in Q1 2024. A sequential approach will allow for better use of available resources (for ESMA, for NCAs, and for respondents).
Details on the duration of each consultation will become available as they are published.
Consultation Package 1
The first consultation package will be published in July 2023. This package includes technical standards for the following mandates:
Article 60(13): RTS on content of notification from selected entities to NCAs
Article 60(14): ITS on forms and templates for notification from entities to NCAs
Article 62(5): RTS on the content of the application for authorisation for CASPs
Article 62(6): ITS on forms and templates for CASP authorisation application
Article 71(5): RTS on complaint handling procedure
Article 72(5): RTS on management and prevention, disclosure of conflict of interest
Article 84(4): RTS on intended acquisition information requirements
Consultation Package 2
The second consultation package is expected to be published by October 2023. This package will likely cover all those remaining mandates with a 12-month deadline, including:
Sustainability indicators
Business continuity requirements
Trade transparency data and order book record-keeping
Record keeping requirements for CASPs
Classification and templates and format of crypto-asset white papers
Public disclosure of inside information
Consultation Package 3
The third and final consultation package is expected to be published in Q1 2024. This package will likely cover all those remaining mandates with an 18-month deadline, including:
Qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments
Monitoring, detection, and notification of market abuse
Investor protection:Reverse solicitationSuitability of advice and portfolio management services to the clientPolicies and procedures for crypto-asset transfer services, including clients' rights

MiCA implementation timeline ðŸ¡«
Supervisory Convergence in the MiCA Transitional Phase
In parallel to the drafting of technical standards, ESMA is working with the national competent authorities (NCAs) on a convergent approach to authorisations of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) during the transitional phase.
The purpose of this supervisory convergence work is to ensure alignment on supervisory expectations related to entities offering crypto-asset services across EEA jurisdictions in the transitional period of MiCA and to promote, from the outset, consistent practices to be used after the entry into application of MiCA, starting with the authorisation regime.
â–¸ List of grandfathering periods
More background on MiCA transitional measures
Member States will have the option of implementing â€˜transitional measuresâ€™ (Article 143 of MiCA) that would allow entities or undertakings already providing crypto-asset services under applicable law in their jurisdictions to continue doing so during the transitional phase of MiCA (i.e., the period of 18-months after full application in December 2024). These transitional measures include:
A â€˜grand-fatheringâ€™ clause Art. 143 (3) â€“ allowing entities providing crypto-asset services in accordance with national applicable laws before 30 December 2024 to continue to do so until 1 July 2026 or until they are granted or refused a MiCA authorisation.
A simplified authorisation procedure Art. 143 (6) â€“ for entities that were already authorised under national applicable law on 30 December 2024 to provide crypto-asset services.
ESMA workplan
During the transitional phase, a mix of regimes (e.g., MiCA or existing bespoke regimes) will coexist across Member States, which may result in disparate levels of protection for consumers of crypto-asset services. To overcome these challenges, ESMA is promoting supervisory convergence between Member States in three ways:
Providing a forum where supervisors from the NCAs can exchange views on practical cases in their jurisdictions, as well as identifying best practices to promote convergence.
Mapping the current landscape for entities providing crypto-asset services among Member States and surveying how each jurisdiction intends to approach the optional transitional measures.
Engaging in ongoing consultations with the Commission to provide the basis for a common understanding (as early as possible) on MiCA provisions that might require further clarity.

About: Interim MiCA Register
Articles 109 and 110 of the MiCA Regulation empower ESMA to publish a central register of crypto-asset white papers, authorised crypto-asset service providers, and non-compliant entities by 30 December 2024. The information displayed in the register is to be provided to ESMA by the relevant National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and the European Banking Authority (EBA).
To meet the legal deadline, ESMA has prepared aninterim MiCA registerwhich will be updated and (re)published at regular intervals.Â The interim MiCA register will be available on this MiCA webpage (and on theDatabases and Registers webpage) as a collection of csv files until mid-2026 when it will be formally integrated into ESMAâ€™s IT systems.
The interim MiCA register consists of five csv files:
White papers for crypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens (Title II);
Issuers of asset-referenced tokens (Title III);
Issuers of e-money tokens (Title IV);
Authorised crypto-asset service providers (Title V);
Non-compliant entities providing crypto-asset services.
Update frequency
Please note that ESMA will publish the latest version of the register on weekly intervals. As such, information that may be reported to ESMA by competent authorities or listed in a national register will not be immediately displayed.
Information on the records displayed in the interim MiCA register
Records displayed in each of the five interim MiCA register files reflect information received by the authorising (or notified) competent authority. In case an authorisation is withdrawn by the competent authority, this record will remain in the publication with the information on the date in which this withdrawal was effective. Further detail on how to interpret the information and formats for each field are available in the following file:
