Abstract
Objective: to substantiate the need to create a universal mechanism of legal 
regulation of digital currencies and tokenized assets, based on a uniform 
categorization of digital assets and the author’s interpretation of the conception 
of digital assets risk, in order to ensure their safe circulation with legal means 
and effective development of the global digital economy in the future.
Methods: the research was carried out with a combination of cognition 
techniques of various levels: from philosophical to private scientific; the key 
position among them belongs to a systemic approach, a comparative legal 
method and a formal-juridical analysis of normative materials.
Results: the present research lays the conceptual basis for building a global 
system of legal regulation of digital assets circulation and facilitates 
identifying and resolving the key issues, necessarily emerging in the 
analysis of the current mechanisms of legal regulation at national level and 
in the estimation of various types of digital assets.
Scientific novelty: consists in a comprehensive consideration of the 
essence and features of the legal nature of various types of digital assets, 
possessing, alongside with significant advantages, high risks from legal and 
financial viewpoints. Based on contradictory approaches and revealed gaps 
in the legal regulation of various types of digital assets, the author proposes 
a uniform categorization of digital assets, substantiates the concept 
of digital assets risk, attempts to substantiate the need to create a universal 
mechanism of legal regulation of digital currencies and tokenized assets, 
which would allow forming an effective system of means to protect property 
right to them and ensure safety of their circulation.

Practical significance: is due to the current absence of a unified approach 
and a possibility to apply the existing legal norms in relation to innovative 
digital assets, taking into account their specificity, despite their trans-border 
character. The main provision and conclusions of the research can be used 
to improve the mechanisms of legal regulation of digital assets circulation.

Introduction
In the recent decades, the global financial system demonstrates a trend for complication. 
Economists define this complication a larger diversity of new financial tools and types 
of financial mediators. The intricate web of bits and bytes, which the modern financial 
system represents, is underlain by the possibility to exchange and transfer capital between 
various participants of economy. Lendees, creditors, investors and entrepreneurs form, 
essentially, four corners of a square. Until recently, the state, being on top of this four-
cornered pyramid, regulated the functioning of all subjects at its base. However, with 
the emergence of digital assets, the possibilities for such regulation have dramatically 
decreased. The reaction of states to such changes varies greatly (Hendrickson & Luther, 
2021), as achievements if the sphere of digital technologies and distributed ledger 
technologies for financial services, which led to a sharp growth of digital assets markets, 
have profound consequences in possibilities to protect consumers, investors and 
business, including data confidentiality and safety, financial stability, national security, 
consequences of criminal actions, etc.
The current practice shows that the approaches of countries (Gonzálvez-Gallego 
& Pérez-Cárceles, 2021), based on attempts to ignore the existing trends and emerging 
problems, just aggravate the situation in their financial system. Much more positive is the 
approach which allows creating systemic legal regulation at intra-state levels, harmonized 
with the international standards currently elaborated. Such regulation should be aimed 
at preventing large-scale risks for the population, economy and financial system of states, 
emerging due to the use of digital assets. Ideal goals of such regulation in the sphere 
of financial technologies and cryptocurrencies lie in promoting innovations, protecting 
market integrity and providing an optimal level of clarity in the market, although regulators 
often fail to achieve all three goals at a time (Yadav & Brummer, 2019). This is due to the 
fact that initially digital decentralized systems were created to avoid such regulation and 
control and to exclude state bodies and banks from their contour of “monetary” circulation 
and commitment of transactions and rights.
1. Essence and features of the legal nature of digital assets
1.1. Blockchain technology as the basis for building a digital ecosystem
Digital assets function as a part of a complex and interdependent digital ecosystem. 
The ecosystem is based on a blockchain – a type of a distributed ledger where transaction 
are registered, participants making deals with each other and decentralized applications. 
Blockchain technology is a radical innovation which may challenge or even replace the 
existing business models relying on the trusted third parties (Beck & Müller-Bloch, 2017).

https://lawjournal.digital   
The blockchain concept was introduced in 2008 with the issuance of “Bitcoin” document1 
and during the first years was used as a technology underlying cryptocurrencies. 
However, as it was not fully programmable, in 2014 the second generation of blockchains 
was presented, which allows programming and executing software – the so-called 
smart contracts – at all participating nodes of a blockchain. Most popular among them 
is Ethereum, which, like other blockchains of smart contracts such as Solana, Terra, BSC, 
allows renting one’s blockchain (storing smart contracts and transactions) and one’s virtual 
machine (necessary for reading and executing smart contracts) out to projects wishing 
to use the decentralized finance (further – DeFi) without the need to support the blockchain 
infrastructure (Hugo & De Quenetain, 2022). DeFi is a new form of financial applications, 
consumer-oriented and consisting of smart contracts deployed on a blockchain technology 
without licenses (Jensen et al., 2021). Hence, any user obtains an opportunity to create 
and introduce software with the common global infrastructure2.
Today, legal regulation of blockchain in different countries is developing in completely 
different ways. Immediate state-level large-scale regulation of decentralized finance markets, 
which are still at an early stage of maturity, may lead to regulation errors and frequent changes 
in legislation, currently observed in a number of states. Moreover, many decentralized 
finance products poorly fit the existing system of financial regulation of many countries 
(Ozili, 2022). However, given that the problems of decentralized finance regulation have 
acquired the global character, it appears necessary to coordinate the efforts of regulators 
to create the rules and procedures of their circulation, under the aegis of a global institute 
of finance management embodied in the International Monetary Fund, Financial Action Task 
Force (further – FATF), Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, International Organization 
of Securities Commissions.
1.2. Essence and classification of digital assets functioning 
on the distributed ledger basis
Digital assets are digital representations of any types of assets, securities, rights, currencies 
or accounting unit, registered in a distributed ledger such as blockchain. There is no common 
system of categorization of digital assets, which is a serious obstacle for regulation and 
management of digital assets, often existing in the international and multi-jurisdiction

environment. Classification of digital assets must depend on their nature and essence, 
i. e. be in compliance with the rights and obligations they impose on their owner, as well 
as on their main economic purpose and function of the asset. Changing the form of an asset 
does not necessarily change its juridical essence, but may lead to an emergence of new 
mechanisms of creating, storing, delivering and transferring of the asset, entailing legal 
consequences. This is easily demonstrated by the example of a digital bond: though the 
asset nature is preserved, the digital form may influence the way of its transfer, hence, entail 
other legal consequences3.
1.2.1. Differences of digital assets from other non-material assets
Unlike other non-material assets based on internal electronic accounting systems 
(for example, unrealized shares), the key characteristics of the “new” digital assets under 
analysis are the following:
a) expandability: rights and obligations may be directly coded in the assets and executed 
automatically;
b) controllability with cryptographic keys: the cryptographic keys are necessary to access 
the assets and sign transactions to initiate the assets transfer;
c) compatibility: digital assets may, with the exception of artificial restrictions, freely 
circulate within the system in which they were issued, and interact with other digital assets 
existing in the same frameworks.
1.2.2. Classification of digital assets
Given all the correlations of notions used by the Russian legislator and common in IT, digital 
assets are virtual assets, i. e. assets created directly in distributed ledgers, and tokenized 
assets existing in real terms, the right to which are placed in the digital environment. Such 
classification is important, first of all, to determine the legal status of each and the probable 
measures for the users’ legal protection. However from the viewpoint of international 
approach, digital assets are most often classified into tokens; within this classification 
it is rather difficult to distinguish criteria to correlate the foreign terminology with the Russian 
one.
In some foreign states there are also contradictions, despite the existence 
of an established classification of tokens; de facto the same tokens may be considered 
utility tokens in one country and investment tokens in another. This leads to an imbalanced 
protection of citizens participating in the circulation of digital assets in various jurisdictions.

The global system of legal regulation of the digital assets circulation may, at least, 
lay the unified terminology, the bases of a uniform classification, stemming from the 
range of rights and obligations provided by certain digital assets. Hence, adhering to such 
conception, it would become possible to create common mechanisms of legal protection 
of the participants of legal relations in the sphere of digital assets circulation. Undoubtedly, 
states may create their own legal mechanisms to regulate aspects of circulation of certain 
digital assets, but, given their trans-border character, a unified foundation is necessary 
anyway.
Non-fungible tokens (further – NFT) should be considered separately. NFT is a new 
type of unique and atomic tokens based on blockchain. Originating as an artistic/gaming 
experiment, NFT generated a new form of entrepreneurship in the virtual world, having 
great advantages and possibilities (Chandra, 2022). They differ from other digital assets, 
such as tokens and coins, in being inseparably connected to the basic asset. Each NFT 
is unique; it cannot be divided or united4. NFTs are mainly used to confirm the property 
right to physical assets (luxurious goods, cars) or digital goods (virtual game assets, 
digital works of art or software licenses)5. Such tokens are regularly exchanged by users 
to confirm that the assets, uniqueness of which is hard to prove (for example, digital 
images), are owned on an exclusive basis6.
While fungible tokens made it possible to create new scenarios of use, like primary 
offers of coins, the potential of NFT as a valuable component is still unclear. Form the 
legal viewpoint, there are no unified legal standards to answer the question: what an NFT 
holder actually owns – the basic asset, its share, or just a right to intellectual rights to it. 
If it is the right to intellectual rights, then it is necessary to define the amount of restrictions 
imposed on them. Some positive changed have occurred recently – for example, courts 
in Singapore and England recognized NFT to be a property (Mezei, 2022), which may 
be protected with an injunction and a freezing order.

1.3. Features of building a legal system of regulation of tokenized digital assets 
in the Russian Federation
Tokenization promotes financialization of an asset by creating a bridge between the 
asset and its digital avatar (i.e. token). Actually, the main advantages of tokenization are 
directly associated with the advantages of distributed ledger technology (further – DLT). 
That is why the increased efficiency, liquidity (Chokor & Alfieri, 2021) and transparency 
are, probably, one of the most often mentioned advantages of tokenization of assets 
and securities.
In an attempt to regulate the circulation of such items, the Russian Federation, 
stemming from the traditions of building a legal system in this country, went its own way, 
renaming a token for “digital right”. Essentially, it is not a new object of right, but, just 
as a token, is a new form of fixation of the existing rights.
Adhering to elaborating a unified terminology within the current legislation, one may 
assert that the rights to objects of civil rights, certified with tokens, being digital rights, 
may be protected with civil-legal means and at the same time, in case of infringement 
upon them, may be recognized as objects of theft in criminal law. Below we correlate 
the existing tokens with digital rights in compliance with Article 141.1 of the Civil Code 
of the Russian Federation (further – CC RF)7.
The Federal Law of August 2, 2019 no. 259-FZ (ed. of July 14, 2022), w.e.f. 
January 1, 2020 “On procuring investments using investment platforms and on 
making changes in certain legislative acts of the Russian Federation” introduced 
the notion of utility digital rights8. They were supposed to be an exact copy of utility 
tokens. However, by implication of law, the latter may be equaled to utility digital rights 
only if created on the platform complying with all the standards of the said Federal 
Law. If a company in any corner of the world refuses to make the changes required 
by the Federal Law of the Russian Federation, than the rights of a person possessing 
tokens within such digital platform are not subject to protection in the territory  
of the Russian Federation.
According to the Federal Law of July 31, 2020 no. 259-FZ (ed. of July 14, 2022) 
“On digital financial assets, digital currency and on making changes in certain legislative 
acts of the Russian Federation”, another type of digital rights in Russia are digital financial

assets9, i. e. investment tokens. They may be represented as monetary claims to the emitter 
or as a right to participate in the capital of non-public joint stock company and rights 
to emission securities, including the transfer demands.
Today, the Bank of Russia has registered three platforms entitled to issue such assets: 
Atomyze,  Sberbank and Lighthouse. Bur provision of deals with digital financial assets 
(exchange, purchase, sale, redemption) may only be performed by the companies from the 
exchange operator register, which will be kept by the Central Bank of Russia. However, not 
a single exchange operator is included into the register.
Rather doubtful is also the position of a legislator expressed in the explanatory note 
to a law draft of March 26, 2018 no. 424632-7 “On making changes in Parts 1, 2 and 
Article 1124 of Part 3 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation”. It says that digital 
rights should be regulated as “an element important for economy”, while “bonuses, virtual 
items, etc. should not, as they do not possess a substantial significance for economy”10. 
In case of bonuses, these are so-called bonus tokens. Recently, marketplaces are gaining 
popularity, which use such tokens instead of loyalty scores. Thus, a loyalty card cannot be 
lost and Internet platforms obtain an opportunity to tokenize their business using all the 
advantages of blockchain technologies.
There are also donation tokens – just scores without any obligations or functional load. 
They are awarded for donations to a project.
One may conclude that a part of utility tokens, bonus tokens and donation tokens are 
not referred to the category of digital rights by a legislator, which is rather odd, given that the 
explanatory note to the said law draft of March 26, 2018 no. 424632-7 introduces the basic 
notion of “digital right” instead of the term “token” in its modern sense of a cipher, possession 
of which provides certain opportunities in the web11.
Assumingly, such decision is due, inter alia, to the fact that bonus tokens and donation 
tokens do not grant access to the blockchain functional and do not provide a proprietary right 
to anything, that is why a legislator excluded the when constructing the notion of a “digital 
right”.
A scrupulous examination allows saying that the approach of the Russian legislator 
is similar to the international one. Most close to the classification of “digital rights” 
introduced into the Russian legal system is the classification of tokens elaborated

by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (further – SEC) and Swiss Financial Market 
Supervisory Authority (further – FINMA). The integration between the FINMA position, aimed 
at evaluating the economic function of token, and the SEC one, based on the evaluation of the 
degree of a token’s relatedness to securities, allowed classifying them into payment tokens, 
or cryptocurrencies, asset tokens, or investment tokens (security tokens), and consumer 
(utility) tokens (Rozhkova, 2020).
Virtual assets include cryptocurrencies (digital currencies, according the Russian 
legislation) and other payment tokens, tokens created through ICO (Initial Coin 
Offering – an offer of digital tokens or coins using blockchain technology (Zetzsche 
et al., 2018)). The harmonization of the Russian legislator position with the global 
trends can be also seen in which cryptographically protected digital ICO assets  
an emitter may sell:
A. Cryptocurrency – a financial tool using modern ciphering for checking and protecting 
online transactions, which can be used in payment of deals with any person ready to accept 
it (Kopaliani, 2022). Such digital assets function via a unique distributed ledger and form 
an integrated payment system with it. A unit of such cryptocurrencies is a coin.
B. Investment token, which is a standard security registered and exchanged 
in a blockchain to reduce transaction costs and to create a record of the property right 
(at that, the basic assets may vary from goods to currencies, real estate and even corporate 
share). They entitle the owner to participate in the emitter’s future incomes and in some 
cases to vote or have other participation rights12.
C. Utility token, which gives its owner consumer rights to an access to a gods or service.
That is, donation tokens and bonus tokens are tool to collect money in crowdfunding 
but not in crowdinvesting.
1.4. Regulation of ICO market
Considering a token within an ICO, it should be estimated exclusively as a means of investing, 
while further circulation of such tokens requires elaborating separate regulations. Funding 
for business projects is raised through issuance and placement among an unlimited range 
of investors of own digital asset tokens in exchange for liquid cryptocurrency13, which may 
in the future be converted into “fiat” money. At that, potential risks for investors are maximally 
high (Hsieh & Brennan, 2022). They may lose their assets both due to an unfavorable financial

situation, for example, as a result of a startup failure, and due to illegal action of emitters, 
for example, fraud, when the money procured are used not only for the purposes of the 
project development.
The Federal Law of August 2, 2019 no. 259-FZ does not stipulate the possibility to make 
investments via cryptocurrencies, although admits it in general14. In this regard, the 
absence of due legal regulation leads to emitters choosing for ICO projects foreign 
jurisdictions with a transparent legislative position and favorable taxation regime. 
But foreign states also attempt to regulate and secure the ICO market. Analysis 
of the US judicial practice shows that the US courts recognize some payment tokens 
as securities, striving to extend the current legal regulation on them. At the same 
time, they specify that investing money into a cryptocurrency used by the members 
of a decentralized community functioning via blockchain technology which is governed 
by the same community, not an integrated enterprise, will hardly be considered a security 
in compliance with the well-known test explicated in S.E.C. vs W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 
293, 298-99 (1946)15. However, in some cases, when emitters try to avoid the US federal 
laws on securities by marking their product as cryptocurrency or a digital token, such 
actions are considered illegal and emitters are obliged to return the money to investors. 
For example, Telegram and TON selling 2.9 billion Grams to 175 buyers for US$ 1.7 bln 
is a part of a larger plan to distribute these Grams in the secondary public market. 
Taking into account the economic realities in compliance with Howey test, the US 
court found that, in the context of this scheme, resale of Grams in the secondary public 
market is an indispensible part of selling securities without an obligatory registration 
statement16. When solving the question of whether a digital asset is a security, SEC 
compares it with an “investment contract”17, which implies “a wide range of multilateral 
investment relations”18 (Jackson, 1999). If a digital asset is expressed in a code, then 
accompanying facts and circumstances, including the means of its distribution, may 
indicate investment activity (Goforth, 2021). Some digital assets based on blockchain 
are considered to be goods. An example is cryptocurrencies, which serve as a means

of storing and transferring value and “may fluctuate in price, like any goods”19. However, 
even if a digital asset is goods, “any specific digital asset may or may not fall within 
the laws on securities”, while “many securities are goods to which laws on securities 
apply”20.
For the purposes of uniformity of state approaches to the regulation of digital assets 
circulation, it is necessary to transfer into a digital format all traditional processes of funding 
and investing, as well as the respective infrastructure. The task is to combine the knowledge 
on capital markets mechanics, normative-legal requirements and technological possibilities 
into a profitable business model, recognized all over the world, which would be useful for all 
participants of the basic ecosystem (Egloff & Turnes, 2021).
1.5. Regulation of circulation of assets created directly  
in distributed ledgers
According to the FATF position, virtual assets are a means of digital expression of value, 
which may be traded or transferred digitally and may be used for payments or investments. 
At that, they do not include the means of digital expression of fiat currencies, securities 
and other financial assets21.
1.5.1. Essence of digital currencies of central banks of states
Such exclusion of digital currencies of central banks from the general concept 
of regulation is quite logical, given the absolutely different nature of this tool and 
possible risks. Studying the possibility of creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC) 
was a priority for many countries during the recent years. CBDC is seen as the next 
step in the development of a global currency regime, with many countries already using 
or piloting a CBDC program (Mack, 2022). For example, the digital ruble created in Russia 
significantly differs from other virtual assets. First, according to the Report for public 
consultations of the Bank of Russia, the digital ruble performs all functions of money, 
being a means of circulation, payment, a measure of value and a saving means. Second, 
it has an emitter guaranteeing reliability and responsibility of the process of the digital

the value equivalent to the cash and cashless forms of ruble22.
1.5.2. Cryptocurrencies as an object of civil rights  
and a target of crime
The growing use of cryptocurrencies (Orr, 2023), combined with the high risks of their 
use for laundering money, financing terrorism and servicing shadow economy 
(Remolina, 2022), required from a legislator to elaborate public-legal provisions, including 
certain requirements to ensure safety of the relevant circulation; thus, on January 1, 2021 
the Federal Law of July 31, 2020 no. 259-FZ came into force, which gives a definition 
of digital currencies and makes steps to regulate their circulation23. However, a growing 
number of contradictions emerging during civil-legal classification of digital assets, as 
well as classification of illegal activities with the use or in relation to cryptocurrencies, 
gave grounds to a legislator to believe that the attempt was not fruitful enough. 
As early as in February 2022, the Russian Government adopted a Concept of legislative 
regulation of digital assets circulation, in which it admitted that currently in Russia 
there is no legislative regulation of such a high-risk financial tool as digital currency 
(cryptocurrency)24.
In this regard, the following judicial positions are rather logical. Ordzhonikidzevskiy 
district court in Yekaterinburg in its decision of July 14, 2021 in case no. 2-2582/2021 
on debt recovery of a loan agreement and interest for the use of loan, the object of which 
were cryptocurrencies, concluded that the use of cryptocurrencies in deals is the grounds 
to refer such deals (operations) to deals (operations), aimed at criminal income laundering 
and terrorism funding25. Hence, all operations with this tool are performed by the civil

circulation participants at their own risk. Judicial protection is not rendered on their requests 
regardless of how grounded they are26.
Cryptocurrencies have a potential to ease processing of small sums with great 
speed and at low costs27. However, cryptocurrency cannot be referred to merely financial 
assets, as it is not money or a share tool of another organization, nor does it generate 
a contract right for the owner to obtain money or financial assets in future; it is also not 
a contract, which clearance will or may be executed with own share tools28. At the same 
time, cryptocurrency may be classified as an object of civil rights, as it can be detached 
and have a property value recognized by circulation29.
Analysis of current practice allows asserting that cryptocurrency regularly serves 
as an object of obligations and is subject to protection by the norms of law of torts. 
The ultimate question underlying most cases refers to the property-legal regime 
of cryptoassets; that is the preliminary question to solve other problems of material 
and procedural law. This issue determines two other trends. First, there is trend for closer 
interaction with some of the further issues associated with the regime of cryptoassets 
in property law. Second, in the world of civil law there is a trend to search for alternative 
routes to ease a regulated legal regime of cryptoassets in more restrictive conceptual 
frameworks peculiar for a civil property right (Allen et al., 2022).
In our opinion, one may agree with the position that cryptocurrency should 
be referred to “other property” by implication of Article 128 CC RF. Then cryptocurrencies 
may be recognized as targets of crime, which especially relevant given their financial 
appeal. At that, positions of court on this issue are sometimes quite opposite.
For example, in the sentence of Solnechnogorsk city court of Moscow oblast 
of October 7, 2020 no. 1-227/2020, the court equals cryptocurrency to electronic payment 
means30. However, according to Part 5 of Article 14 of Federal Law of July 31, 2020 
no. 259-FZ, legal and physical persons in the Russian Federation cannot accept digital

currency in consideration for goods transferred to them, works performed by them, services 
rendered to them or any other means enabling to assume payment with digital currency 
for goods (works, services)31.
A completely different position was held by Saint Petersburg city court, which did not 
agree with the defense when considering the appellation of P. for a sentence of Petrogradskiy 
district court of Saint Petersburg of December 20, 2021, in which P. was accused of the crime 
stipulated by clause “b” of Part 3 of Article 161 of the Russian Criminal Code. The defense 
claimed to eliminate the breaches of criminal-procedural law committed by the first instance 
court and to exclude from the scope of charges theft of cryptocurrency as an item without 
a legal status. Saint Petersburg city court found that digital currency in the form of bitcoins, 
bitshares and digibytes, stolen by P. and E., may be considered property as it was and is used 
as a means of payment, investment and storage of savings, i. e. is of economic interest, 
and has a material value32.
Third cassation court of general jurisdiction supported the opinion of Saint Petersburg 
city court, stating that essentially the main difference of cryptomoney from money is just 
the way of their emergence, and as the notion of cryptocurrency is not legislatively stipulated, 
in the accusation it should be referred to “other property”33. Such positions of court enable 
to protect with criminal-legal means the violated rights of cryptocurrency owners under legal 
uncertainty.
Earlier Saint Petersburg city court had found an interesting solution in a situation when 
digital currency was a target of infringement. In an Appellate decision of December 20, 2021 
on case no. 1-19/2021, 22-5752/2021, the court stated that it does not accept the reasons 
of defense that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not a target of extortion, as their value 
is not registered by the state and circulation of cryptocurrency is not regulated by the state: 
initially V.A. extorted money, while cryptocurrency was just a means to hide the transfer 
of that money34.

The now revised draft of Federal Law “On digital currencies”, developed by the Ministry 
of Finance of the Russian Federation, stipulates legalization of cryptocurrency sphere 
in Russia. Given that under sanctions cryptocurremcy is one of the quickest, most convenient 
and effective means of payment, this draft of law is supposed to allow payments in the foreign 
trade activity of legal persons and entrepreneurs for goods, works, services and intellectual 
activity with digital currencies. The draft of law also stipulates licensing of digital currency 
exchange operator and digital platform operator, that is, it will be possible to register crypto 
exchanges in the Russian Federation. However, the draft of law does not so far determine 
sanctions for breaches in the proposed order of cryptocurrencies circulation and illegal 
actions of its participants. In general, analysis of this draft of law allows ascertaining that 
the process of regulating the cryptocurrencies circulation in Russia will be similar to the 
legislation provisions on regulating the securities market, i. e. will stipulate rather tough 
requirements and standards.
1.5.3. Legal protection of persons owning virtual currency and virtual property 
in the Russian Federation
Other payment tokens are virtual currencies (Vandezande, 2017). European Central Bank 
defines them as a type of unregulated digital money, issued and usually controlled by their 
developers and used and accepted among the members of a certain virtual community35. 
Essentially, virtual currencies are intended for using in specific virtual spheres or world, such 
as global multiuser online games36.
Although virtual currency is legally not subject to exchange for fiat currency, practice 
shows that it is virtual currency, alongside with non-cash and electronic money, that 
becomes the target of infringement in computer fraud (Savel’yev, 2014). Accordingly, 
the issue of regulating its circulation in the territory of the Russian Federation will allow 
creating conditions for legal protection of persons owning such currency.
Claims occur more and more often in judicial practice, which are directly associated 
with mass multiuser online games37. However, court decisions on them in the Russian 
Federation are mostly restricted to a reference to Article 1062 CC RF, stating that an online 
game is a game, by its definition and purposes of creation indicated in a license agreement;

hence, it is not subject to Article 1062 CC RF38, according to which judicial protection is not 
extended on requirements of citizens and legal persons associated with organization 
of games and wagering and participating in them39.
However, there are court decisions considering virtual currencies within consumer 
rights protection claims. For example, Lefortovo district court of Moscow acknowledged 
that game currency is a measurement unit of the volume of rights for using additional 
functional of an online computer game, granted to a user by showing a certain amount 
of measurement units of gamer’s rights on an intra-game personal account, which may 
be purchased or acquired without money (as a bonus for certain activities in the game, 
for example, participation in an intra-game auction). However, in this regard, the amount 
of “virtual currency” accrued on the intra-game personal account does not reflect the 
flow of actual money between the game administration (defendant) and the account 
owner40.
The issue of regulating the “virtual property” circulation is not less acute, given 
the rapid commercialization of the multiuser online games market. Basically, “virtual 
property” is just a computer code, aimed mainly at imitating the objects of real (physical) 
world in the digital space. The solely virtual form of existence of such objects does 
not hinder their circulation, which touches upon the interests of real consumers, as the 
process of their acquisition and disposition is based on an obvious consumer value 
(Russkevich & Frolov, 2020).
The above makes it possible to assert that the contemporary world of cryptoassets and 
decentralized finance continues to rapidly evolve, being characterized by a rich combination 
of innovations, risks (Almaqableh et al., 2022) and normative problems. It is the unified legal 
approaches to regulating the circulation of digital assets all over the world that are able 
to minimize the said risks.

2. Estimation of risks occurring during the digital assets circulation
In order to elaborate the global legal bases to regulate the said market, it is necessary, first 
of all, to estimate the risks (He et al., 2022) emerging during the digital assets circulation. 
Understanding the concept of digital assets risk may lead to effective results for both 
investors and regulators.
2.1. Volatility risk
The value of digital assets is highly volatile, i.e. their price may rapidly fall or rise at any time, 
including within one day (Naeem et al., 2022). Hence, investments into digital assets are 
considered highly speculative investments. There is a risk of significant or complete loss 
when purchasing or selling digital assets (Shen et al., 2022). Market prices may significantly 
differ from a company fair value or an investment opportunity in case of non-liquid/low-
liquid assets. Although the volatility of digital assets is so high and varies significantly, 
it may increase depending on the technological changes and achievements, fraud, theft and 
cyber-attacks (Tsuchiya & Hiramoto, 2021; Caporale et al., 2021), against which there are no 
sufficient means of legal protection under the current legal nihilism of users. On the other 
hand, sharp changes in normative-legal regulation may even more aggravate the volatility 
of digital assets, increasing the potential of investment profits and losses. Besides, digital 
assets have no historical experience of other currencies or goods such as gold, which could 
have helped to determine if the current volatility levels are typical or untypical.
2.2. Risk of incorrect evaluation
The order of tokens evaluation directly depends on their type. For example, the price for 
payment tokens depends on the dynamics of supply and demand at global level and does 
not rely on the traditional evaluation methods used for securities, which significantly 
complicates determination of their objective value. Digital currencies only exist virtually 
in the computer network and have no physical equivalent; hence, it is difficult to determine 
their value, as it depends on the expectations and trust in possibility to use them for future 
payment operations. As for the utility tokens, there are no tested methods for their evaluation 
at all. Some of the utility tokens issued have no internal value except the possibility to use 
them to access or use a service/good to be developed by the emitter. At that, there is no 
guarantee the services/goods will be successfully developed. The situation with investment 
tokens evaluation is clearer. It is influenced by such commonly known factors as: analysis 
of discounted monetary flows, liquidity or non-liquidity premium depending on the term 
of existence of the company and trading platforms. However, assets tokens bear risks 
associated with the basic company or asset, as many companies procuring funds are private

2.3. Liquidity risk
Market capitalization of the cryptoassets industry is mainly headed by bitcoin with over 50% 
of the overall market capitalization (Wu et al., 2018). In the market of digital assets other 
than bitcoin, there may be periods of reduced liquidity and even non-liquidity. There are no 
guarantees that a private company successfully executes a primary public share placement 
or provides an alternative exit strategy for the capital invested. In relation to investment 
tokens, the liquidity risk is the probability that the company will not be able to fulfill its 
financial obligations at the time of their redemption. A purchaser of assets tokens may 
suffer financial losses when selling them during circulation at an expected price, including 
due to the lack of sufficient demand or insufficient volume of operations, as well as the lack 
of representative market level of prices (Arsi et al., 2021).
2.4. Technological risk
The technologies associated with digital assets are at the early stage of development. 
Accordingly, technological achievements in the sphere of cryptography, code hacking, 
quantum computations, etc. may pose a risk for the safety of digital assets. Also, there 
may appear alternative technologies, which may make some digital assets less relevant 
or obsolete. The functioning of digital assets is based on open source software, into which 
errors can be introduced during programming. Also, developers may cease developing open 
source software potentially at a critical stage, when safety requires updating, as a result 
of which digital assets will be subject to failures and programming errors, while the risk 
of fraud, theft and cyber attacks will also increase (Corbet et al., 2020). Some digital assets 
networks suffered a sharp increase of the number of transactions during the recent years. 
The increased number of transactions combined with the inability to introduce changes 
into the digital assets technology may lead to a decreased time of transaction processing 
or a significant rise of commission fees for transactions with digital assets, paid to miners 
to ease their processing.
2.5. Hardfork risk 
As there is no central authority (for example, a central bank or  a government agency) 
controlling the development of technologies associated with digital assets, the 
functioning of digital assets and their further improvement (for example, the possibility 
to increase a number of transactions, decrease processing time, reduce commission 
fees for transactions, introduce safety updates) depends on cooperation and consensus 
of various stakeholders, including developers improving the open source software 
associated with the  digital asset, or miners facilitating the processing of transactions. 
Any disagreement between the stakeholders, linked with making essential changes in the

blockchain protocol may lead to the digital asset network being divided into two or more 
incompatible versions (Schär, 2020). As a result, the trading platforms where the digital 
assets are traded may suspend the possibility to trade a certain version of the digital 
asset.
2.6. Criminal risks associated with the digital assets circulation
Special characteristics of digital assets (for example, only exist virtually in a computer 
network, operations with digital assets are irreversible and anonymous) make them 
an attractive target for fraud, theft and cyber attacks (Caporale et al., 2019). There 
are various tactics for stealing digital assets or damaging the technology of digital 
assets (“attack 51”, when an opponent may obtain control over the digital assets 
technology by providing 51% of computer power in the digital assets network; at that, 
there are currently no laws in the world directly stipulating punishment for “attack 51” 
(Conklin et al., 2022); “Denial of Service Attack” (SmurfAttack), when a wrongdoer tries 
to make the digital assets network resources inaccessible by overloading it with service 
requests; Sybil-attacks, when one person attempts to grab a peer-to-peer network 
by creating several accounts, nodes or computers41; spoofing attack (substitution), when 
a fraudster pretends to be some reliable source; malicious software attacks (Higbee, 
2018)). For example, on October 8, 2022, Binance, the world largest cryptocurrency 
exchange, confirmed that, as a result of jacking of a blockchain network managed by it, 
the total of US$ 570 mln in cryptocurrencies were stolen (Conklin et al., 2022). Recently, 
cases of cryptocurrencies extortion became rather common, which are associated with 
cyber attacks at critical information infrastructures.
There are other possible options of criminal behavior in the sphere of digital assets 
circulation. Most often, cryptocurrencies are used for legalization of money or other property 
acquired as a result of committing crime (laundering), or are used as a bribe. However, due 
to the lack of relevant legal regulation in the sphere under consideration, the possibilities 
of bringing criminals to liability are limited.
Besides, digital assets are subject to a higher than usual risk of market abuse, market 
manipulation and insider deals, due to the existing gaps in regulation, surveillance, control 
over market and liquidity.

2.7. Operational risk
Basic level transactions in DLT or another distributed ledger are irreversible and final, while 
the transactions history cannot be altered computationally. As a result, if a user initiates 
or requests a transfer of digital assets using a wrong address of the distributed ledger, 
it will be impossible to identify the receiver and cancel the defective transaction. Besides, 
substantial risks of illegal misuse of information emerge due to the public character 
of actions in the ubiquitous distributed ledger.
2.8. Credit risk and counteragent risk
In case of tokenized securities, the risk of default or bankruptcy of the basic emitter 
is substantial, in accordance with the private investments into joint-stock capital and/
or private debt-based investments.
2.9. Specific risks associated with the storage of digital assets
Possessing a digital asset is equivalent to possessing a private key (a code matched 
with a blockchain address), which provides access to it. A loss or theft of the private key 
matched with a certain blockchain address make it impossible for the owner of such private 
key to identify themselves as a legal holder of the digital tokens recorded at the respective 
blockchain address.
2.10. Special risks associated with the tokenized securities, tokens 
of securities or DLT-based securities
Tokenized securities are accounted outside the traditional custodian system, and their 
transfer is subject to legal uncertainty. The property right to tokenized securities is determined 
by recording the digital tokens connected with these securities in the decentralized ledger 
kept by the users’ community. The blockchain technology appeared not long ago. In many 
jurisdictions, the legal and regulatory regime, applied when this technology is used 
in financial sector, remains disputable. That is why one cannot exclude disputes over some 
aspects of acquisition and transfer of tokenized securities in the form of digital tokens, 
such as, for example, the transfer validity. Traditional frameworks of fighting against 
money laundering and terrorism funding do not expand to tokenized securities. Placement 
and storage of tokenized securities may be performed without involving professional 
custodians but through a transfer of digital tokens recorded in a decentralized ledger. That 
is why the mechanisms usually applied to prevent money laundering and terrorism funding 
are, as a rule, not applied in this case. To be able to determine the source of the capital 
procured and avoid becoming a receiver of illegal funds, the emitter usually relies on the 
anti-money laundering (AML) standards.

This said, the actually existing tokenized assets are perceived much more positively 
by the states, from the viewpoint of risk assessment, than those created directly in distributed 
ledgers, due to the greater safety of their circulation. This is also confirmed by the opinion 
of experts from Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, who in June 2021 classified 
them into three groups, calling to analyze the nature of each particular cryptoasset when 
determining the risk value. The least risks are shown by material and non-material assets 
of group 1a, which includes traditional assets represented in the form of tokens42.
2.11. Legal risks
International consensus on the standards of regulation of digital assets circulation 
is still not found. The current legislation is subject to constant changes which may 
entail varied reactions of regulatory and other state bodies and influence the issuance 
of certain digital assets, possibility of trading them in the internal and global markets, 
and the possibility to transfer or convert digital assets, potentially increasing the risk 
of complete or partial loss of units or reduction of their value (including up to zero). With 
the development of regulation all over the world, there is also a risk of inconsistency 
of regulation in various jurisdictions, which may lead to certain operations being 
recognized as legal in one jurisdiction and illegal in another43. Today, by the adopted 
principle of cryptocurrencies regulation, all states can be divided into ignoring, 
approving and prohibiting. The latter are still very few, but China is among them. These 
states mainly emphasize the need to introduce central banks digital currency in their 
jurisdictions and to ensure its transborder circulation. The first group of states is the 
most numerous. They adopted various means of coexistence with new financial tools – 
“sandbox” regimes, partial adaptation of the existing legislations to new realities, 
or introduction of their own classification of tokens. In any case their position is based 
on clear conviction that it is not worth rushing things and adopting special normative 
legal acts aimed at regulating cryptocurrencies, while no uniform global standards are 
elaborated. The third group of states admits the priority of cryptocurrencies advantages 
over the risks associated with their circulation, assumes the inevitable increase 
of cryptocurrencies market volume, and makes attempts to get recognized as a global 
cryptohub.

The financial innovations pose huge problems for state policy and normative-legal base 
in terms of providing financial stability; these problems must not be ignored. That is why 
the surveillance approach must take into account both advantages and risks accompanying 
financial innovations, as well as the adequacy of regulatory measures. From the viewpoint 
of central banks, the task of ensuring financial stability remains pivotal. In the light 
of the changing financial landscape, one may assert that the financial stability depends 
on the adequacy of risk management systems and control by the market participants, on the 
one hand, and on the due surveillance measures of the regulator, on the other. That is why the 
state as a regulator must take up a more active role, using the combination of prescriptive 
and market-oriented approaches.
Legislative regulation of digital economic space and provision of information protection 
and safety of digital financial operations, as well as improvement of the system of legal 
regulation of digital assets per se will minimize the economic risks in financial system 
of the states.
Conclusions
1. Digital assets as new objects of property economic relations existing in the information-
communication network – the Internet – are currently the basic tool of digital economy 
subject to significant risks.
2. Digital assets are the latest technological innovations introduced via blockchain 
and DLT, leading to revolution and other paradigmatic changes in the sphere of financial 
services. This technology changes the means of management and creation of wealth, 
as well as the interaction between users and money or financial products.
3. The lack of solid and integral normative-legal base for digital assets aggravates the 
vulnerabilities of the digital ecosystem. Many elements of the digital assets ecosystem are 
elaborated so as to avoid regulation. Digital assets do not fit the existing normative-legal 
base. Besides, the controlling impact is often hidden (for example, in DeFi) or distributed 
(for example, blockchain validators). Regulatory bodies should focus on the essence 
of a basic asset and related rights, not on its form, unless the form changes the essential 
nature of the asset.
4. A critically important condition of digital economy development in Russia is the 
provision of confidence of all economic subjects in their protection in the digital space. This 
can be achieved, first of all, by forming and developing the normative-legal base ensuring 
protection of rights of the participants of digital assets circulation and implementation 
of mechanisms of fighting with crimes in this sphere.
5. It is necessary to determine, how digital assets and cryptoassets can be objects 
of property law in the legislations of respective jurisdictions, be it by making amendments 
in general provisions or by creating an isolated special regime.

6. In order to understand whether (and how) working with a digital token has legal 
consequences for rights in the real world, one may need further clarification on the part 
of national legislations regarding juridical recognition of purely digital objects. In particular, 
whether a non-material, digital representation can be recognized as an object of property 
rights.
7. Today, given the risks analyzed in this research, we consider most correct the position 
of the group of states which selected a rather “ignoring”, or “wait-and-see” position, monitoring 
the course of events, striving to moderate the cryptocurrencies markets and minimize 
the losses by embracing them in the usual financial regulation while continuing the special 
regulation to fight with money laundering and terrorism funding.
8. Elaboration of a global legal regulation of digital assets circulation will allow 
avoiding situations when a digital asset is recognized as not subject to protection and 
forced execution in a certain jurisdiction, and will ease the task of revealing and forced 
recovery of digital assets in case a fact is established of committing a crime in relation 
to them or using them.

Аннотация
Цель: обоснование необходимости создания основанного на едино-
образной категоризации цифровых активов и авторского понимания 
концепции риска цифровых активов унифицированного механизма 
правового регулирования цифровых валют и токенизированных акти-
вов для обеспечения безопасности их оборота правовыми средства-
ми и эффективного развития в будущем цифровой экономики на гло-
бальном уровне. 	
Методы: исследование проводилось посредством комбинирован-
ного сочетания разноуровневых средств познания: от философских 
до частнонаучных, ключевое место среди которых отводится систем-
ному подходу, методу сравнительного правоведения и формально-ю-
ридическому анализу нормативного материала. 
Результаты: представленное исследование закладывает концептуаль-
ную основу построения глобальной системы правового регулирования 
оборота цифровых активов и способствует определению и решению 
ключевых вопросов, которые необходимо возникают при анализе дей-
ствующих механизмов правового регулирования на национальном 
уровне и оценке законности различных видов цифровых активов. 
Научная новизна: заключается в комплексном рассмотрении сущности 
и особенностей правовой природы различных видов цифровых акти-
вов, обладающих наряду с существенными преимуществами высокими 
рисками как с правовой, так и с финансовой точек зрения. На основе 
противоречивых подходов и выявленных пробелов в правовом регу-
лировании различных видов цифровых активов автором предлагает-
ся единообразная категоризация цифровых активов, обосновывается 
концепция риска цифровых активов, предпринимается попытка обо-
снования необходимости создания унифицированного механизма пра-
вового регулирования цифровых валют и токенизированных активов,

что позволит сформировать эффективную систему способов защиты 
права собственности на них и обеспечить безопасность их оборота.
Практическая значимость: обусловлена отсутствием в настоящее вре-
мя унифицированного подхода и возможности применения действую-
щих правовых норм в отношении инновационных цифровых активов, 
учитывающих их специфику, несмотря на их трансграничный характер. 
Основные положения и выводы исследования могут быть использо-
ваны для совершенствования механизмов правового регулирования 
оборота цифровых активов.
