ARTICLES
comprehensive implementation of electronic declaration, national database and electronic certificates in the Registry Office of Cameroon;
problems of technological equipment, Internet accessibility and digital literacy of the population;
empirical evidence on the digitalization of public services in Cameroon, relevant to the global South;
development of adaptable solutions for the digital development of public administration, applicable in countries with similar challenges.
Objective: to study the innovative transformations in the field of e-Governance introduced into Cameroon’s civil registration system during the 2024 legislative reforms. The focus is on assessing the impact of these transformations on improving governance efficiency, transparency, accessibility of services for citizens, as well as improving statistical accounting of vital events.
Methods: the work uses general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, classification, systematic and functional approaches, as well as formal legal and comparative legal methods.
Results: the research shows that measures like introduction of electronic declaration of civil status acts, creation of a national database and transition to electronic certificates can dramatically improve the efficiency and accessibility of services for the population. However, the authors emphasize that the successful implementation of digital innovations requires overcoming significant barriers, such as insufficient technological equipment, limited Internet access, and low digital literacy of citizens. These challenges make it necessary to develop additional regulatory and support mechanisms. Particularly important is the balance between digitalization and ensuring the rights of citizens in the context of electronic registration.
Scientific novelty: the work provides unique empirical data on digitalization of public services in Cameroon. This is especially important for the countries of the global South, where such transformations are slow and fragmentary. The study makes a significant contribution to the scientific debate by expanding understanding of digital technology adoption models through the lens of expected usefulness and perceived ease of use in developing countries.
Practical significance: recommendations for legislators, government officials and other stakeholders were developed. The authors emphasize the need to adopt a regulatory framework as soon as possible, introduce educational programs for employees and citizens, and ensure access to digital technologies. These measures aim at creating a sustainable infrastructure for an effective transition to electronic systems and improving the quality of public services. The work contributes to the study of public governance digitalization, offering both theoretical concepts and practical solutions that can be adapted for other countries with similar challenges.
comprehensive analysis of the evolution of approaches to intellectual property regulation in the context of artificial intelligence;
aspects of determining the authorship of works created using artificial intelligence and critical consideration of anthropocentrism in modern legislation;
analysis of conflicts between existing European copyright legislation and new technological realities;
improving of intellectual property legislation, taking into account technological progress and judicial precedents.
Objective: a comprehensive critical analysis of the modern legal regulation of artificial intelligence technologies arising at the junction of intellectual property and artificial intelligence norms. Special attention is paid to the study of conflicts between existing European copyright legislation and new technological realities.
Methods: the work uses an interdisciplinary approach, including historical, formal-legal and comparative-legal research methods. The historical method allowed tracing the evolution of legislative and doctrinal approaches to intellectual property regulation in the era of digitalization. The formal-legal method made it possible to conduct a detailed analysis of the legal norms of various states. The comparative-legal method provided an opportunity to compare different approaches to regulating relations in the use of artificial intelligence for creative activities.
Results: the study examines the issues of copyright for works created using artificial intelligence, including complex aspects of determining authorship, as well as the issues of anthropocentrism in modern legislation. The author analyzes judicial precedents, mainly in the context of the European Union legislation, which is actively adapting to new technological challenges. Various approaches are investigated to determine the legal status of works created using artificial intelligence and their impact on traditional intellectual property concepts.
Scientific novelty: the article presents a unique comprehensive assessment of the impact of the AI creative capabilities on the fundamental intellectual property concepts. The scientific significance lies in the author’s original assessment of the impact of artificial intelligence technologies on copyright legislation, based on a detailed analysis of judicial precedents and doctrinal approaches. The author investigate the prospective development of legal regulation in the context of technological progress.
Practical significance: the paper proposes legal and governmental solutions aimed at creating a balanced and effective intellectual property regime in the era of artificial intelligence. Recommendations were developed to improve legislation, taking into account existing judicial precedents and the needs of the digital economy. The research results can be used to develop new regulations and improve the existing legal framework of artificial intelligence regulation.
comprehensive analysis using PESTEL analysis and the ‘five why technique’ to identify key issues and offer tailored solutions;
creation of a global system for fighting AI-crime with clear principles of responsibility, strict security standards and constant adaptation to new challenges;
applicability of existing product quality liability and negligence laws to crimes related to artificial intelligence;
specific measures aimed at creating a sustainable system for regulating artificial intelligence and combating crimes in this area.
Objective: to study the applicability of existing norms on product quality liability and negligence laws to crimes related to artificial intelligence. The author hypothesizes that the hybrid application of these legal mechanisms can become the basis for an effective regulatory system under the rapid technological development.
Methods: the research includes a comprehensive approach based on the PESTEL analysis (political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal factors), the “five whys” root cause analysis, and cases from various countries. This multi-level approach allows not only identifying key problems, but also proposing adapted solutions that take into account the specifics of crimes related to artificial intelligence.
Results: the research shows that the existing norms on product quality and negligence are not effective enough to regulate crimes related to artificial intelligence. The main obstacles are technological complexity, lack of precedents, lack of consumer awareness, and jurisdictional issues. The author concludes that effective regulation requires a global system that includes clear principles of responsibility, strict safety standards, and constant adaptation to new challenges.
Scientific novelty: the paper represents a unique approach to the crimes related to artificial intelligence through the prism of hybrid application of existing legal mechanisms. It offers a new perspective on the problem, combining theoretical analysis with practical recommendations based on case study.
Practical significance: recommendations for legislators and regulators were developed. The author emphasizes the need to create specialized agencies, introduce educational programs for citizens and employees, and to provide funding for research in the field of explicable artificial intelligence and security standards. These measures are aimed at forming a stable regulatory system capable of effectively countering crimes related to the use of artificial intelligence. The work opens up new horizons for further research on the regulation of AI technologies and emphasizes the need for international cooperation and an interdisciplinary approach.
uneven digitalization of languages and limited access to natural language processing technologies;
indirect and cumulative effects of discrimination caused by generative artificial intelligence models;
development of innovative methods of analysis and regulation to combat new forms of digital inequality;
measures to reduce the risks of digital inequality and linguistic discrimination.
Objective: to study the impact of digital inequality on the implementation of constitutional human rights; to identify the risks of linguistic discrimination associated with the development and use of large language models.
Methods: formal-legal and comparative-legal methods, as well as the method of theoretical modeling. These approaches are complemented by general scientific methods of cognition, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the legal, technological and social aspects of the issue.
Results: the research found that, in relation to large language models, digital inequality arises due to the uneven digitalization of languages and manifests itself in limited access to natural language processing technology. In turn, unequal access to this technology can negatively affect the implementation of constitutionally guaranteed rights and can be viewed from the viewpoint of equality and non-discrimination concepts. The author emphasizes that unequal access to natural language processing technologies can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities and create new forms of discrimination.
Scientific novelty: hidden and indirect forms of discrimination are analyzed that manifest themselves in artificial intelligence systems, especially in generative models. While direct forms of discrimination can be detected in predictive algorithms, generative models create more subtle but no less significant cumulative effects. These effects contribute to the formation of social stereotypes and inequalities in areas such as professional activity, gender and ethnicity. The author also draws attention to the fact that with the increasing autonomy of artificial intelligence, traditional approaches
to discrimination detection are becoming less effective, which requires the development of new analysis and regulation methods.
Practical significance: the results provide a basis for identifying and assessing the legal risks associated with unequal access to digital products using natural language processing. This contributes to the improvement of legal regulation in the field of the development and use of artificial intelligence technologies. The article offers recommendations for lawmakers, regulators, and technology developers aimed at minimizing the risks of digital inequality and linguistic discrimination.
evolution of European Union legislation on behavioral biometrics;
insufficient differentiation of behavioral and physical biometrics technology according to the European Union legislation;
developing clear definitions of behavioral biometrics and mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability;
recommendations for improving the regulation and implementation of behavioral biometrics technologies.
Objective: to study the historical development of the European Union legislation on behavioral biometrics; to identify the features of the European approach to the regulation of behavioral biometrics, to assess its advantages and disadvantages.
Methods: general scientific methods of analysis and comparison, with an emphasis on the study of legal texts such as directives, regulations and conventions. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the issue, the authors also consider the technical aspects of behavioral biometrics, which allows for a comprehensive analysis of both legal norms and the technological processes underlying them.
Results: the research demonstrates that the European Union regulatory legal framework on biometrics does not clearly distinguish between behavioral and physical biometrics technologies. This leads to ambiguity in understanding the risks and opportunities associated with the use of behavioral biometrics. The authors emphasize that the insufficiently specific legislation creates significant difficulties for regulators, technology developers, and end users.
Scientific novelty: the article is the first comprehensive study of the historical development of European Union legislation on behavioral biometrics. The work reveals the key characteristics of the European approach, its strengths and weaknesses, and compares it with the United States’ regulatory practice. The study reveals the key aspects that require further regulation: from a clear definition of behavioral biometrics to the development of comprehensive mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of these
technologies. Given that behavioral biometrics is a relatively new and rapidly developing technology, the research is important for understanding current challenges and prospects for its regulation.
Practical significance: the research is multifaceted and relevant for experts in digital technologies: legal scholars, law enforcement officers, legislators, and developers of artificial intelligence and biometrics technologies.
flexible information security governance system adaptable to the unique needs of any organization;
the developed system is consistent with international standards and regulatory requirements;
the proposed system makes it possible to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the employees;
the recommended system is universal and can be adapted for organizations of any scale and profile.
Objective: to develop universal organizational and legal principles for building an information security governance system that will allow each organization to create its own effective information security governance system, taking into account its unique business goals and tasks.
Methods: the research integrates the key elements of information security governance, such as vision, strategy, goals, policies, standards, processes, and matrices. Vision and goals set the direction of an organization’s development; policies and standards provide a conceptual framework for information protection; processes allow for systematic achievement of objectives; and matrices provide tools for evaluating and monitoring the entire structure. The proposed principles are consistent with international
standards, regulatory requirements, and best practices in the field of information security.
Results: the research showed that the developed information security governance system allows for a clear distribution of roles and responsibilities among the employees, ensuring effective implementation of the governance system. The authors also analyzed the existing principles of information security, integrating them into a security strategy that meets the corporate goals. The proposed universal system complies with regulatory legal requirements and can be adapted for organizations of any scale and profile.
Scientific novelty: the paper represents a practical approach to the implementation of an information security governance system based on the authors’ experience, international standards, control systems and legal acts. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed system is flexible and can be adapted to any organization, which makes it a universal tool for information security governance.
Practical significance: the research provides a structured approach to creating a universal information security governance system that can be used by organizations lacking knowledge and resources to implement such initiatives. The authors propose a general structure that can be adapted depending on the organization’s assets, the employees’ training and awareness of information security issues. This makes the paper a valuable resource for professionals seeking to increase information security in their organizations.
key problems of introducing artificial intelligence into healthcare: data bias, lack of algorithmic transparency, privacy violation risks;
developing adaptive legal mechanisms to balance the use of artificial intelligence and the preservation of human rights;
comprehensive methodological approach: integration of classical legal methods with modern comparative legal studies;
strengthening public confidence in AI technologies and their positive impact on the healthcare system.
Objective: to identify key ethical, legal and social challenges related to the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare; to develop recommendations for creating adaptive legal mechanisms that can ensure a balance between innovation, ethical regulation and the protection of fundamental human rights.
Methods: a multidimensional methodological approach was implemented, integrating classical legal analysis methods with modern tools of comparative jurisprudence. The study covers both the fundamental legal regulation of digital technologies in the medical field and the in-depth analysis of the ethical, legal and social implications of using artificial intelligence in healthcare. Such an integrated approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the issues and well-grounded conclusions about the development prospects in this area.
Results: has revealed a number of serious problems related to the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare. These include data bias, nontransparent complex algorithms, and privacy violation risks. These problems can undermine public confidence in artificial intelligence technologies and exacerbate inequalities in access to health services. The authors conclude that the integration of artificial intelligence into healthcare should take into account fundamental rights, such as data protection and non-discrimination, and comply with ethical standards.
Scientific novelty: the work proposes effective mechanisms to reduce risks and maximize the potential of artificial intelligence under crises. Special attention is paid to regulatory measures, such as the impact assessment provided for by the Artificial Intelligence Act. These measures play a key role in identifying and minimizing the risks associated with high-risk artificial intelligence systems, ensuring compliance with ethical standards and protection of fundamental rights.
Practical significance: adaptive legal mechanisms were developed, that support democratic norms and respond promptly to emerging challenges in public healthcare. The proposed mechanisms allow achieving a balance between using artificial intelligence for crisis management and human rights. This helps to build confidence in artificial intelligence systems and their sustained positive impact on public healthcare.
