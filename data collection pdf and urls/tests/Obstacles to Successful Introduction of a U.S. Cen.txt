Abstract
Exploring the possibility of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) has been a high priority for numerous countries over the last few years. A CBDC seems to be the next development in the global currency regime, with many countries already using or piloting a CBDC program. The United States and its accompanying central bank—the Federal Reserve - have recently shown strong interest in developing and issuing a CBDC. While the government is deeply entrenched in researching possible CBDC outcomes and strategies, it appears to lack research and development into a proper regulatory scheme that will ensure a well-ordered rollout of the CBDC.The United States’ monetary and financial regulatory regimes are ones that are notably fragmented among numerous federal and state agencies, some of which perform overlapping or quite similar duties. This issue of regulatory fragmentation and overlap among regulators exists in numerous respects with regard to the issuance and creation of a U.S. CBDC. For this reason, among others, it is paramount that the federal government coordinate between and within its branches to ensure that the next development in U.S. Currency - a CBDC - is created, issued, and regulated in a way that minimizes regulatory overlap and enhances intragovernmental communication and cooperation.
