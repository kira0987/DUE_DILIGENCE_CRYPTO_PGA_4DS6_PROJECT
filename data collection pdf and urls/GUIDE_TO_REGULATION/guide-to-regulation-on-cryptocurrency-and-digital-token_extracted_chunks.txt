A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand 2023 Edition (The law as of 29 August 2023) ii A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand Digital assets in Thailand In 2022 and 2023, following the collapse of the key global players in the crypto industry, regulators around the world closely scrutinized crypto activities and tightened the regulations for digital asset businesses. This tightening primarily concerns the protection and segregation of customers' assets, which has become standard practice since the crypto crash. Over the past year, we have witnessed a series of enforcement actions and attempts by offshore regulators to classify various types of digital asset products and determine whether these products should be classified as securities. Building upon the aforementioned trends in the digital asset industry, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued new regulations and held public hearings. These initiatives aim to enhance investor protection and strike a balance between supervising and fostering the development of the crypto industry. To keep up with the dynamic and evolving regulatory developments, we have revised this publication to provide an updated overview of regulations pertaining to digital assets in Thailand.

Applicable laws The starting point for understanding digital asset regulations in Thailand is the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses, B.E. 2561 (2018) (the "Digital Asset Decree"), which specifies a new asset class (digital assets) to be regulated under Thai law. From its effective date (14 May 2018), any business operator who wishes to conduct any activity regarding digital assets must take this law into account. To determine whether the digital instrument you are planning to issue would fall under the definition of digital assets, you must consider the Digital Asset Decree and other existing laws, including the Securities and Exchange Act, the Payment Systems Act, and the Derivatives Act. Certain types of instruments or assets that utilize innovative technology or digital elements, such as securities under the Securities and Exchange Act, e-money under the Payment Systems Act, and option instruments under the Derivatives Act, are regulated under other specific laws

and regulations, not the Digital Asset Decree. To illustrate, digital securities are to be regulated under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Act, and not the Digital Asset Decree, because their core characteristics fall under the definition of what constitutes "securities". Some types of instruments or assets that did not fall under the scope of existing laws before 14 May 2018 might now be regulated under the Digital Asset Decree if they have specific characteristics that fall within the definition of "digital assets" as prescribed in the Digital Asset Decree. 2 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand Part II. Digital assets law The following is an overview of how digital assets are regulated in Thailand. Thailand's regulatory regime Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses, B.E. 2561 Offering of digital tokens ▪ Digital token ▪ Cryptocurrency ▪ Issuer ▪ Portal Digital asset businesses ▪ Digital asset exchange ▪ Digital asset broker ▪ Digital asset dealer ▪ Digital asset fund manager ▪ Digital asset advisor ▪ Digital asset custodial wallet provider Emergency Decree on Amendment of the Revenue Code (No. 19), B.E. 2561 New types of income ▪ Share of the profit or any benefit derived from holding or having possession of digital tokens. ▪ Capital gains from the transfer of a cryptocurrency or digital token. Withholding tax obligations 3 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand 1 How can we differentiate between cryptocurrencies and digital tokens, and how are they regulated? Under Thai law, digital assets comprise two types of assets: cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. Cryptocurrency Digital token ▪ Electronic data unit. ▪ Created on an electronic system or network. ▪ Being a medium for exchanging goods, services, rights, or digital assets. ▪ Other electronic data unit as designated by the SEC. ▪ Electronic data unit. ▪ Created on an electronic system or network. ▪ For determining: 1. The right of an investor to invest in any project or business (i.e., investment token). 2. The right to receive specific goods, services, or other right as agreed (i.e., utility token) ▪ Other electronic data unit as designated by the SEC However, a cryptocurrency can be deemed a digital token if the issuer intends to raise funds from the public, and if the cryptocurrency: a) determines the right of an investor to invest in any particular project or business; or b) determines the right to receive specific goods, services, or any other right as agreed upon by the parties. The key difference between these two types of assets is that a cryptocurrency is created to serve a particular purpose as a medium of exchange, which might be for goods, services, or other rights, or as consideration for trading with other digital assets. A digital token is generated to be used as a determinant of rights, which could be rights as an investor or the right to receive specific goods or services. 4 A Complete Guide to the

Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand 2 Overview of the regulatory regime on the offering of digital tokens and operation of a digital asset business There are two regulated activities under the Digital Asset Businesses Decree: 2.1 Offering of digital tokens to the public 2.2 Operation of digital asset businesses Thailand's regulatory regime on the offering of digital tokens to the public 5 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand 2.1 Offering of digital tokens to the public A. Digital token offering To offer regulated digital tokens (e.g., investment tokens, utility tokens for which the underlying products or services are not ready-to-use as of the date of offering) to the public, the issuer must: (i) have the specified qualifications; (ii) obtain approval from the SEC Office; and (iii) file a registration statement for the offering of digital tokens, and the draft prospectus, to the SEC. The offering must be done through the approved portal. To promote investment tokens, the Thai Revenue Department issued the Royal Decree in August 2023 concerning an exemption related to the improvement of taxation for investment tokens. In summary, both the corporate income tax and value added tax (VAT) exemptions are available for the offering of investment tokens in the primary market whereas the transfer of investment tokens in the secondary market will also be exempt from VAT. The rationale behind this is that investment tokens, similar to securities, may be categorized as equity or debt, and consequently, the tax obligations for the offering and sale of investment tokens, both in the primary and secondary markets, should be similar to those applicable to securities. B. Proposed rules on ready-to-use utility tokens In January 2023, the SEC held a public hearing regarding the draft regulations of ready-to-use utility tokens. The SEC proposed that an issuer of ready-to-use utility tokens should be separated into two groups and regulated as follows: Group 1: Ready-to-use utility tokens issued for consumption purposes or as a digital representation of a certificate Primary market Exempt from offering activity requirements. Secondary market The business operators are exempt from digital asset licensing requirements for operating or providing services (e.g., a marketplace) related to this type of token. Licensed digital asset exchanges, brokers and dealers are not permitted to list or provide services related to this type of token. Group 2: Ready-to-use utility tokens not specified in Group 1 (e.g., native/governance tokens, DeFi/CeFi/GameFi tokens, and exchange tokens) 6 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand Primary market If the token will be listed on a licensed digital asset exchange, it is subject to offering activity requirements (For further details please see Part 3.1). If the token will not be listed on a licensed digital asset exchange, it is exempt from offering activity requirements. Secondary market The business operators are subject to digital asset licensing requirements for operating or providing services related to this type of token. Licensed digital asset

exchanges are permitted to list this type of token if the token does not have prohibited characteristics and is in line with the listing rule. In addition, there are other requirements, such as not being a "Means of Payment: MOP" according to the BOT's guidelines and restrictions regarding a staking program. These proposed rules for ready-to-use utility tokens are still subject to the result of the public hearing and have not been finalized. These new rules could potentially impact the business plans of licensed business operators and token issuers, and an in-depth analysis will be necessary once the rules are finalized. C. Exempt offering: limited offering Offering of regulated digital tokens that contain one of the following elements is considered a limited offering, and therefore it is deemed that the issuer has already obtained approval from the SEC Office and is exempt from the requirements for filing the registration statement and draft prospectus. ▪ The offering is made to any one of these types of investors: institutional, and ultra-high net worth. ▪ The offering is made to a specific investor who has a specific relationship with the issuer, as prescribed in the regulation. The offering must be made to not more than 50 people within a 12-month period. ▪ The offering has a total value not exceeding THB 20 million within a 12-month period. However, the issuer must: (i) comply with other regulations prescribed by the SEC (including offering through an approved portal); and (ii) create and disclose a report on the sale of digital tokens and the information regarding the holding of digital tokens by each type of investor. D. Real estate digital token offering The SEC Office has issued a set of regulations governing digital token offerings that refer to, or for which the cash flow comes from, real estate. A real estate digital token offering must comply with the key additional following conditions and requirements, which are summarized below. ▪ Real estate The construction of the underlying real estate must be complete and ready for use, without being subject to any property rights or disputes. There is an exception in which the token issuer has considered and issued an opinion in writing to the effect that these will not materially affect its use, and that the terms on which the real estate is acquired will be beneficial for digital token holders in general. ▪ Investment value 7 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand The amount or value of the investment in real estate must not be less than 80 percent of the project's amount or value, or the aggregate value of the real estate to be invested in must not be less than THB 500 million. ▪ Due diligence Due diligence must have been conducted on the real estate, so as to comply with specified requirements, with complete and sufficient information on risk factors disclosed in the registration statement and draft prospectus. ▪ Appraisal There must be a full

appraisal of title documents for disclosing information to investors. This must be carried out by at least two appraisers, who have been approved by the Office of the SEC, or who fulfil specific requirements if the real estate to be invested in is located overseas. ▪ Legal formalities The contract to acquire the real estate must not contain any agreement or obligation that may prevent the sale of the real estate at a fair price. A draft trust deed must be prepared and must fulfil the requirements in the applicable regulations. There must be a mechanism to ensure that the issuer will transfer assets to the trustee as an asset pool of the trust. ▪ Types of tokens If there are different types of digital token, the same type of digital token must have equal rights and benefits, while each type of digital token can have different rights and benefits but only regarding the following: (i) Benefits or return of capital to holders of digital tokens. (ii) Fees or expenses to be claimed from holders of digital tokens. (iii) Other differences that the issuer may demonstrate as the practical categorization of digital tokens, considering the benefits of holders of digital tokens in general, and possible effects on holders of digital tokens. ▪ Establishment of a trust The issuer must set up a trust with any of the following elements: (i) Trust for the holding of ownership or right of possession over real estate. (ii) Trust for investment in leasehold rights in real estate. (iii) Trust that holds shares in a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that holds the ownership or right of possession over real estate, whereby: ▪ The shareholding is at least 75 percent of the total number of issued shares, representing at least 75 percent of the total voting rights of the SPV; ▪ The shareholding is for the benefit of token holders to prevent assets of the SPV from being distributed, sold, transferred, or encumbered, without the trustee's approval, and which must comply with the trust deed. ▪ Trustee The trustee must be appointed with specified roles and qualifications as set out in the regulations. 8 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand Based on the SEC’s public hearing, there could be some additional changes and revisions to the regulations regarding the real-estate backed tokens. E. Proposed rules on debt-like and infra-backed tokens In June and August 2023, the SEC proposed to classify the new type of investment tokens that are debt-like and infra-backed tokens, and subsequently issued the draft regulations to regulate these tokens. The SEC views that these tokens are structured similarly to existing securities under the securities law. In this regard, the SEC set out the new offering regulations for debt-like and infra-backed tokens to be comparable with debt securities or infrastructure trusts, as the case may be. For example, the specific requirements relating to the issuance of infra-backed tokens may include, but are not limited to, asset

due diligence and appraisals, trustee roles and responsibilities, asset management of the issuer, and limitations of the greenfield project and underlying assets. These proposed rules for debt-like and infra-backed tokens are still subject to the result of the public hearing and have not been finalized. F. Relevant parties ▪ Portal Once a portal has received SEC approval, it is obligated by law to conduct due diligence and a screening process. However, inspection of the portal is not the final stage of approval for a prospective issuer, as the SEC Office may still reject any proposed digital tokens offering project if it believes that the project conflicts with public policy, or on any other reasonable grounds. As of 29 August 2023, the SEC had approved seven entities as licensed portals in Thailand. You may consider engaging any of these approved entities if you wish to offer digital tokens to the public in Thailand. (See: https://market.sec.or.th/LicenseCheck/views/DABusiness?ico/en.) ▪ Issuer An issuer must obtain prior approval from the SEC Office and must file a registration statement and draft prospectus with the SEC Office before the public offering. The offering of digital tokens can only be done through an SEC-approved portal. 9 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand 2.2 Operation of a digital asset business A.

Furthermore, in June 2023, the SEC proposed additional exemptions to reduce the costs and burdens for the business operators. While this proposed rule is not yet effective, it reflects the SEC’s intention to promote the digital asset industry and will relieve some of the burden from business operators, once effective. A license applicant could be a bank, securities company, other financial institution, or a newly established company. However, the applicant must ensure that it has all of the qualifications and meets all the requirements in the regulations to be prescribed by the SEC. As of August 2023, the SEC has not yet granted any digital asset custodial wallet provider license to anyone. To promote the custodial wallet business in Thailand, the SEC held another public hearing on 23 August 2023 to propose some relaxation in the regulations. Any other business designated by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). These operators must obtain a license from the MOF upon the recommendation of the SEC, and must comply with certain regulatory requirements. ▪ For the list of licensed entities, please visit the SEC website: https://market.sec.or.th/LicenseCheck/views/DABusiness?exchange/en B.

Please note, however, that the issuer of stable coins will also need to take into account other applicable laws such as the payment system law and currency law, under the supervision of the BOT and the MOF. 11 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand 3 Guideline for various types of market participants 3.1 Guideline for entities planning to issue digital tokens A.

Based on the SEC’s recent public hearing no. 41/2566 (23 August 2023), it intends to adjust the investment limit of retail investors by removing the investment limit in the case of real-estate backed and infra-backed tokens, from the original limit of THB 300,000 per person per offering. ▪ Regarding the issuer, the offering limit for retail investors in each round of offering is the higher of ≤ four times the shareholders' equity of the issuer, and ≤ 70 percent of the total offering amount per round. ▪ The issuer may receive THB or "approved cryptocurrencies by the SEC Office" (i.e., BTC, ETH, XRP, and, XLM) for payment for digital tokens. 13 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand E.

Timeline The digital asset business operator must begin its business operations within 180 days from the date that it obtains approval from the SEC. 19 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand D. Ongoing requirements for digital asset businesses There are a number of key additional requirements that digital asset business operators should take into account. Custody of customers' assets Asset-keeping business operators must keep no less than 90 percent of the total customers' assets in a cold wallet. An operator may keep the assets in its own cold wallet if the total value of the customers' assets is below THB 15 million. If the total value is THB 15 million or more, and the operator keeps the assets for more than five consecutive days, the assets must be kept in a custodian service provider's wallet. The SEC has also amended and strengthened the rules on custody of assets, which include the following key contents: ▪ The use of customers' assets, fiat money, or digital assets for the benefit of another client or any other person is prohibited. ▪ Seeking benefits from customers' digital assets is prohibited, including in the form of deposit and lending to other persons. ▪ The digital asset business operator must deposit customers' fiat money with commercial banks. The digital asset business operator and the customers may agree on an interest rate not exceeding the actual rate the business operator receives from the commercial banks. ▪ Customers' assets must be reconciled every business day to ensure accurate and updated records of customers' assets. Operation of other businesses If a business wishes to operate a new business line, it must be able to demonstrate that the new business line supports the core business, and that it will not create a conflict of interest with the digital asset business, or pose a risk to the customers' assets. If the new business meets

the mentioned criteria, the business operator could carry on the new business without the SEC's approval; otherwise, approval from the SEC will be granted on a case-by-case basis. Outsourcing A business operator wishing to outsource key aspects of its businesses must be able to demonstrate that it has implemented appropriate measures as prescribed by the applicable regulations, and the outsourcing agreement must have the substance as prescribed by the SEC. 20 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand Listing rules A licensed digital asset exchange is restricted from selecting and listing a digital token that has the following characteristics: ▪ Meme token. ▪ Fan token. ▪ Non-fungible token (NFT). ▪ Digital token issued by digital asset exchanges themselves or related persons, and used in blockchain transactions. A licensed digital asset business operator is also prohibited from providing services regarding privacy coins. Restriction on payment by digital assets In March 2022, the SEC issued a notification that prohibits licensed digital asset business operators from acting or providing any service in a manner that will promote, support, or encourage the use of digital assets as a means of payment for goods and services. The prohibition includes advertising; providing any wallet service, system, or tool that would facilitate the acceptance of digital assets as payments, and to transfer digital assets from a customer's account to another for the purpose of making payment. Restriction on deposit taking and lending services Since June 2023, digital asset business operators are restricted from providing, supporting, or advertising any services that involve deposit taking and lending. The prohibition includes promising returns or benefits from depositing the digital asset with the digital asset business operator, unless; ▪ the staking of digital assets are part of blockchain consensus mechanism, ▪ it is a distribution of the digital assets received from a blockchain hard fork or soft fork and the airdrop from token issuers, ▪ it is a promoting activity which is in line with the SEC’s marketing rules, and ▪ it is general information or knowledge sharing on decentralized finance. Advertisements Digital asset business operators will be prohibited from advertising specific cryptocurrency in public spaces. Digital asset business operators may only advertise their services (rather than specific cryptocurrency), and only through their own respective official advertising channels, in order to prevent impulsive buying. Digital asset business operators are also obliged to seek the SEC's approval before running each advertisement, and to report the advertisement costs to the SEC. Furthermore, the service of an introducing broker agent for digital asset operators regarding cryptocurrency (but not digital tokens) is prohibited. 21 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand IT standards To ensure business operators' IT security, the SEC sets the rules on the establishment of information technology systems. This is summarized below: ▪ Establishing IT-related risk assessment criteria to define the entity's risk level, and to specify standards of IT security controls and oversight that are suitable to

apply to licensed entities. ▪ Separating clear roles and responsibilities for departments and responsible persons, to ensure the "three lines of defense" principle. ▪ Setting the requirements and guidelines to be in line with international standards and financial IT regulations. Wallet management and key management In December 2022, the SEC issued regulations and guidelines regarding wallet and key management, which became effective on 16 January 2023. According to the regulations, the digital asset operators that keep customers' assets must prepare: 1) policy and guidelines for overseeing risk management and management of digital wallets; 2) policy and procedures for developing and managing digital wallets securely; and 3) a contingency plan in case an event occurs that may affect the management system of digital wallets and keys. These requirements could be used as references for the SEC's minimum standards concerning wallet and key management. In practice, it requires a thorough review of the policies and operational systems to ensure that the business operators comply with the minimum standard set out by the SEC. 3.5 Guideline for entities planning to issue NFTs or operate an NFT marketplace A non-fungible token (NFT) is a form of a digital token with unique characteristics that cannot be replaced by the same type of electronic unit and amount. Generally, the issuance and trading of NFT is not regulated by the SEC, unless the NFT falls under the scope of digital assets as specified by the regulations. That is to say: (i) Is not a medium of exchange for acquiring goods, services, or any rights or exchange between digital assets. (ii) Does not specify the right of a person to participate in an investment in any project or business. (iii) Does not specify the right of a person to acquire specific goods, specific services, or any other right. If the characteristics of the NFT deem it to be a digital asset – meaning it has any of the characteristics described in items (i), (ii), or (iii) above – (1) issuance would be subject to offering requirements; and (2) the platform allowing the sale and purchase could be considered a digital asset business, depending on the details of the platform. For this reason, a platform that acts as a marketplace could be subject to requirements under the digital asset law, such as the requirement to obtain a digital asset business license. If the particular NFT is merely storage of the underlying digital file (such as an image, audio file, or video file) using blockchain technology, without providing any other additional right to the holder, and if it is not possible to separate the token from its underlying digital file, that NFT will not be considered as a digital asset under the SEC regulations and the Thai digital asset law. It should also be emphasized that digital asset exchanges in Thailand are not allowed to list NFTs to be traded on their platforms. 22 A Complete Guide to the Regulations on Cryptocurrency and Digital Token Offering in Thailand Part III.
