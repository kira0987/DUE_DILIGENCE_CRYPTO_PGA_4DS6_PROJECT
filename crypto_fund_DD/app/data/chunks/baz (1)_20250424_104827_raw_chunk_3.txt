1. SUMMARY 
 
Booming development of the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies opens up great opportunities for 
investors. The recent years saw growing volumes of capital flow into cryptocurrencies, both as a way to increase 
wealth through speculation and as a way to safeguard assets from inflation in traditional economies, or as a 
means to fund projects based on decentralized platforms. For individual investors, the great variety of opportunities on the cryptocurrency market can be daunting, 
which entails risks of losing assets or missing opportunities due to lack of access to undervalued assets. Venture crypto fund CryptoBazar Fund was established as a solution.
