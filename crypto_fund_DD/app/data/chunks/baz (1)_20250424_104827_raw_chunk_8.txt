OUR TEAM 
 
As investors, we have been involved in the InvestBazar since 2013 working on the markets of Russia, the CIS, and 
over 40 other countries that have become our subscribers. The InvestBazar Fund, our conventional investment 
fund, invests exclusively in SMEs in the real economy and currently manages over $15 mln USD. Over the years, 
we have built an extensive partner network spanning Russia, the CIS, and Europe that brings us 1,500–2,000 
investment applications per quarter. We have an effective selection system that allows us to identify the best 
business projects and teams. Since 2013, we have been hosting open events where the strongest projects can 
pitch to private investors of different specializations. In 2017, we launched a crypto-division within InvestBazar — CryptoBazar that focuses on three major areas: 
a) CryptoBazar ICO Accelerator — online acceleration for projects and preparing ICO launches; 
b) CryptoBazar Events — events for promoting and developing the blockchain industry and presenting 
upcoming ICOs to investors; 
c) CryptoBazar Fund — investing in projects prior to ICO launch. www.CryptoBazar.io

In 2017 we organized a series of CryptoBazar Demo Days and CryptoBazar Exclusives in Russia, Germany, Poland, 
Cyprus, Dubai, Monaco, Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong and USA. The vision of CryptoBazar for the coming 1.5 
years is to create the largest international partner infrastructure that will allow industry players to get access to 
the most interesting and forward-looking cryptocurrency projects and get an opportunity to invest in these 
projects at their earliest stages under the most lucrative terms. A video-summary of our events is available at:
