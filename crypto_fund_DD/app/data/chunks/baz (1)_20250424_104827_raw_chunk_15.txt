10.1. Trust Management 
 
Although blockchain technology allows for anonymity and confidentiality, the operation of the CryptoBazar Fund 
is based on the principles of transparency and openness. Trust management is carried out within the bounds of the jurisdiction applicable for investors. When 
investors entrust tokens for asset management, this does not entail transfer of token ownership to Managing 
Partners. The Fund and the investor are aware that interactions between the parties are considered confidential 
information and can be disclosed to third parties only in cases stipulated in the applicable legislation (except for 
third parties that Managing Partners contract in order to fulfill their obligations under the contract with the 
investor). Any publicly available information is not considered confidential. The Fund, acting as an entity that handles personal data, carries out a set of administrative and technical 
measures to protect personal data and ensure confidentiality of personal data. Managing Partners handle personal data of Clients based on the Clients' consent to processing of their 
personal data in the form of a signed Statement of Accession.
