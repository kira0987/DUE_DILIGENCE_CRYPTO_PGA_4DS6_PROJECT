ICO INVESTING: RISKS 
 
Similarly to conventional venture investing, investing in ICOs can produce returns with high multiples. No other 
investment vehicle — lending, stocks, trading, etc. — can generally match the ROI of venture investing that 
literally multiplies the capital. Current ICOs demonstrate remarkable performance too, averaging at 30,000% ROI. www.CryptoBazar.io

However, just like any investment, both conventional venture investing and investing in crypto-ventures entail 
certain risks and have specific aspects, some of which are listed below. • 
A risk to miss out on a solid project because of a growing information overload, contradictory opinions 
and project assessments before ICO launch, or simply due to lack of access to quality projects prior to ICO. • 
A risk to draw up a poorly structured deal even if the project is great, lose your capital or a sizable share 
of returns. • 
Risk of having your assets frozen for a long time. • 
Risk of having to get involved into operations management if the project team is weak. • 
Risk of funding a substandard project and losing the entire investment. Bottom line is that to make smart choices on the crypto-market, investors need access to a good selection of 
quality projects, proper due diligence, well-structured deals, competent capital management and exiting projects 
at the right time to secure returns. Venture crypto fund CryptoBazar Fund was established to let investors do 
exactly that.
