INVESTMENT TERMS 
 
A) Entry fee. Any time when a buyer invests through the CryptoBazar Fund, 4% of issued tokens are withheld as a 
Fund's fee that is used to finance the Fund's operation. B) Exit fee is 0%. C) The Fund's performance fee levied on all returns is 35% of portfolio growth. Performance fee calculation: 
1. The fund performance is calculated daily and depends on the performance of each asset in the fund’s 
portfolio (price of tokens in the portfolio on crypto exchanges); 
2. Performance fee of the fund is calculated together with the evaluation of the total fund performance on a 
daily basis; the fee is withdrawn from the fund by the fund managers only during those days when the 
CBT price is over the last CBT price when the fee was collected* (“hurdle rate” – CBT price at which the 
last performance fee was withdrawn by the fund managers) 
3. The Fund withdraws its 35% performance fee only and entirely from the fund’s profit and when the new 
CBT price is higher than the last CBT price when the performance fee was collected (higher than the 
hurdle rate) 
4. Such daily mechanics makes the performance fee calculation and collection transparent and predictable 
to every co-investor and allows to avoid considerable CBT price fluctuations due to the accumulated fee 
withdrawals. This daily process also makes the profit distribution fare to every co-investor – from the 
early co-investors to the recent ones.
