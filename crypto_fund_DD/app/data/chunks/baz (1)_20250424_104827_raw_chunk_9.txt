CryptoBazar Fund INVESTMENT STRATEGY 
 
Most investors who look to invest in ICOs only make investments at the ICO stage itself, whereas the CryptoBazar 
Fund enters projects BEFORE they launch ICOs. This strategy has several advantages: 
• 
The best option in terms of return within any given project; 
• 
Possible preferential exit rights; 
• 
Means to increase investment in a project through favorable options for additional purchase of shares or 
tokens at pre-ICO prices. In the standard ICO launch process, it is clearly seen that investing at the earliest stages yields the highest returns.
