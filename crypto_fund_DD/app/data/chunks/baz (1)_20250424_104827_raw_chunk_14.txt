TOKENS 
 
The Fund has issued 100,000,000 CryptoBazar Tokens (CBT) on the Waves platform (www.wavesplatform.com). The tokens are held in a reserve account and transferred to co-investors against crypto-investments made to the 
Fund in Bitcoin. The number of tokens in the reserve accounts and traded on the market is reflected in the Fund's 
regular reporting. Each time a co-investor makes a BTC transaction to the Fund, the Fund releases reserve CBT at a rate calculated 
daily at 12:00 PM GMT. Token price = Fund's portfolio value / Tokens in circulation 
Investments = Co-investor's tokens / Token price â€“ entry fee commission 
 
Once a co-investor transfers CBT back to the CryptoBazar Fund, such CBTs a returned to the reserve account of 
the fund. Co-investor receives BTC back to his wallet in return for the CBT at the CBT rate set for the date of the 
transaction a 12:00 PM GMT. Token price = Fund's portfolio value / Tokens in circulation 
Investment = Co-investor's tokens / Token price (no fees on exit) 
 
Co-investors can also buy or sell CBT on the free market, including the decentralized exchange inside the Waves 
wallet, in the CryptoBazar / Bitcoin pair.
