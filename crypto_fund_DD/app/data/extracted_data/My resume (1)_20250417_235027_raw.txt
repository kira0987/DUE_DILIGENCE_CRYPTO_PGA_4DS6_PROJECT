PROJECTS  
 
Sign Language Detection Model : Developed a CNN-based model to detect and classify sign language 
gestures for 3 alphabets (A, B, L). 
Customer Churn Prediction : Predicted customer churn using many models such as XGBoost and 
Gradient Boosting, applying CRISP-DM methodology. 
Crypto-ema-streamlit-app : Learn how to connect to the Binance API using Python, analyze crypto data 
with EMAs, and build a fully interactive Streamlit app from scratch. 
REALTIME-Cryptocurrency-Prices-with-Python : I am pulling realtime cryptocurrency prices 
(Bitcoin, Ethereum,...) using the Binance websocket API. 
Web-Scraper : Building Scraper AI , an AI-powered web scraping solution to extract, analyze, and 
visualize web content effortlessly. 
Toxicity detection model : This project aims to create a tool that can automatically detect and classify 
toxic comments using deep learning techniques.
