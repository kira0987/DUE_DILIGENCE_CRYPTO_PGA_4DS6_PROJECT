Technical Architecture Document (TAD) : Due Diligence
on Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets Funds
This project aims to:
Collect data from multiple sources on digital assets and cryptocurrencies.
Build structured pipelines for data engineering.
Generate a dynamic question bank using reverse engineering and prompting
techniques with Generative AI (GenAI).
Develop a system to answer questions based on multiple documents from crypto funds
Generate detailed reports in PowerPoint format based on the data and insights.
