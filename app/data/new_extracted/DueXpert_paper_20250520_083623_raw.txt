Manuscript received January 20, 2025; revised May 19, 2025. Thesis defense scheduled for May 21, 2025. This
research project was conducted as part of the final-year Integrated Engineering Project in Data Science at ESPRIT
University. The project was carried out in collaboration with VALUE Company, Tunisia, and supervised by the
academic faculty of the Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. It follows the Team Data Science
Process (TDSP) methodology to design and implement an AI-powered due diligence system for crypto funds,
integrating document processing, risk assessment, and answer generation using machine learning and natural
language processing.
Abstract: The rapid growth of the cryptocurrency industry has created an urgent need for scalable,
intelligent tools that support effective due diligence. Traditional methods of evaluating crypto funds are
time-consuming, manual, and ill-suited to the fragmented and fast-changing nature of decentralized
markets. This paper presents DueXpert, an automated due diligence platform that leverages state-of-
the-art AI components—including NLP, Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG),
and LSTM-based forecasting—to assess legal, financial, and reputational risks associated with crypto
investment opportunities. The system integrates document parsing, risk scoring, real-time question
answering, and report generation into a unified workflow guided by the Team Data Science Process
(TDSP). Through real examples and evaluations, we demonstrate how DueXpert enhances the speed,
accuracy, and transparency of crypto fund analysis. The platform not only reduces operational over-
head but also empowers investors and regulators to make informed decisions with greater confidence.

1. Introduction
The rise of cryptocurrencies has transformed the financial landscape by introducing digital assets
that operate on decentralized networks, without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks or
governments. This decentralized nature offers many advantages, such as increased transparency,
faster transaction times, and borderless transfers. However, it also introduces new challenges,
particularly in how investors and regulators assess the risks and legitimacy of crypto-investments.
Due diligence is a critical process in traditional finance that involves thoroughly investigating
and verifying an investment opportunity before committing funds. It helps ensure that investments
are legitimate, comply with regulations, and align with the investor’s risk tolerance and objectives.
In the context of cryptocurrencies and crypto funds, due diligence becomes even more complex
due to several factors:

Automated Due Diligence of Crypto Funds Using AI and TDSP
• Rapid Market Evolution: The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and evolves much
faster than traditional financial markets. New tokens, protocols, and regulations frequently
emerge, making it difficult to keep up with all relevant information.
• Fragmented and Unstructured Data: Information related to crypto funds is scattered across
multiple sources, including regulatory filings, whitepapers, blockchain transaction data, news
articles, and social media. Much of this data is unstructured or semi-structured, requiring
significant effort to collect, clean, and interpret.
• Lack of Standardization: Unlike traditional assets, crypto investments often lack standard-
ized reporting formats or universally accepted evaluation frameworks, which complicates
direct comparisons and objective assessments.
• Regulatory Uncertainty: Cryptocurrency regulations vary widely by jurisdiction and contin-
uously evolve, increasing the difficulty of ensuring compliance through manual processes.
These challenges mean that traditional due diligence methods, largely reliant on manual research
and expert analysis, are increasingly insufficient. They are time-consuming, costly, and prone to
human error, often taking weeks or months to complete for each investment. This creates barriers
for both retail and institutional investors seeking to make timely informed decisions.
This research addresses these challenges by developing DueXpert, an automated platform
that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and natural language processing
(NLP) to revolutionize crypto fund due diligence. DueXpert integrates data from diverse sources,
applies AI-driven document parsing and analysis, provides tailored responses to the questions
listed in the question bank, and produces comprehensive real-time risk reports. By automating
key components of the due diligence process, the platform significantly reduces cost and time,
while improving the accuracy and reliability of investment assessments.
The development and implementation of DueXpert are systematically guided by the Team Data
Science Process (TDSP) methodology, which provides a structured framework from business
understanding through deployment and evaluation. This ensures that the solution is not only
technically robust, but also aligned with stakeholder needs, scalable, and maintainable over time.
This paper presents the full scope of the project, describing its motivation, technical design,
data processing pipelines, AI models, evaluation results, and deployment architecture. Through
DueXpert, our aim is to empower investors, regulators, and fund managers with a faster, smarter,
and safer tool to navigate the complex and dynamic world of cryptocurrency investments.
2. Related Work
Several existing solutions have explored aspects of due diligence automation in the context of
cryptocurrencies, but they typically remain limited in scope or technical depth.
Tools such as ChainSecurity and MythX focus on smart contract auditing by applying static
and symbolic analysis methods to identify vulnerabilities in code. These tools are valuable in
detecting programming risks but do not address fund-level concerns such as team transparency,
legal compliance, or financial planning.
Platforms like TokenInsight and ICOBench offer high-level project scores and investment
grades. However, these rely on shallow metrics, heuristics, and community voting, which lack
methodological transparency and fail to explain the underlying reasoning or data sources used in
the evaluation.
In the academic space, Liu et al. proposed a machine learning approach for classifying Initial
Coin Offering (ICO) whitepapers using document features and shallow neural networks [1]. While
effective for binary classification tasks, this method does not scale to nuanced, multi-label risk
assessments or dynamic document querying. Similarly, Zhao et al. [2] investigated entity extraction
in token-related documents using supervised models, which require significant manual annotation
and are sensitive to domain shifts.
Unlike these works, DueXpert is designed as an end-to-end due diligence automation platform.
It integrates GraphRAG-based document analysis, risk-specific question answering, and financial

forecasting into a unified pipeline. Our system goes beyond static rule-based checks and offers
interpretability, flexibility, and dynamic analysis capabilities that better reflect the complexity of
real-world crypto fund assessments.
3. Problem Definition and Business Understanding
3.1. Context and Challenges
The cryptocurrency market has seen rapid growth, attracting a wide range of investors, from
individual retail investors to large institutional funds. However, this fast growth has brought several
challenges, especially in evaluating investments in crypto funds. Traditional due diligence, which
is essential to assess the legitimacy and risk of investments, faces significant difficulties in the
crypto space.
One of the biggest problems is the cost and time involved in manual due diligence. Typically,
creating a due diligence report on a crypto fund can cost anywhere from $15,000 to $50,000
and takes one to three months to complete. This makes it difficult for many investors, especially
smaller ones, to conduct thorough evaluations. The process is slow because it requires experts to
go through large amounts of data, such as white papers, financial reports, transaction histories,
and regulatory documents, by hand.
In addition, the crypto industry has a high level of fraud and regulatory risk. In 2024, crypto fraud
losses alone reached $5.6 billion, which shows the urgent need for better ways to detect fraud.
These scams include everything from Ponzi schemes to money laundering, taking advantage
of the complexity and lack of transparency in blockchain networks. In addition, cryptocurrency
regulations are constantly changing and vary between countries. This makes it difficult to stay up
to date and ensure compliance with the law, which increases the risks for investors.
Current due diligence platforms do not cover the full range of activities required for a comprehen-
sive evaluation. Although some platforms provide isolated services, such as market data analysis
or compliance checks, few offer end-to-end automation. This means they don’t bring together all
the necessary tasks, such as collecting data, analyzing documents, detecting fraud, and ensuring
regulatory compliance, into a single real-time system. Without an integrated, automated solution,
it’s difficult for investors to get a complete picture of a fund’s risk, leading to slower decision-making
and higher costs.
3.2. Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to develop DueXpert, an AI-powered platform that will address
the challenges faced in traditional crypto fund due diligence. DueXpert is designed with several
key objectives that will streamline the due diligence process, making it faster, more affordable,
and more accurate for investors and fund managers. These objectives are as follows:
• Develop a Due Diligence Application: The primary objective is to build a clear and struc-
tured application for conducting due diligence on cryptocurrency funds. This application en-
sures that each fund is evaluated based on consistent and well-defined criteria, such as
market analysis, regulatory compliance, and financial health. It provides the foundation for
assessing risks and opportunities in a systematic way, eliminating the subjectivity and incon-
sistency found in manual evaluations. The application also serves as the basis for automating
the entire review process.
• Identify Key Risk Factors: DueXpert focuses on identifying the specific risks that are
common and critical in the context of crypto assets. These include fraud, lack of regulatory
compliance, market volatility, and security vulnerabilities. The system is designed to detect
these issues through analysis of fund documents, financial data, and blockchain activity. It
classifies risk into different categories and contributes to generating a risk score that reflects
the overall health and reliability of the fund. This score provides a fast, reliable signal for
investors and stakeholders.
• Provide Automated Solutions: Another key goal of the project is to reduce the time, cost,
Vol. xx, No. xx, June 2009
Page 3

IEEE Transactions on AI for Financial Technologies
Automated Due Diligence of Crypto Funds Using AI and TDSP
and manual effort involved in the due diligence process by providing automated solutions.
DueXpert automates data collection through APIs, web scraping, and document extraction. It
processes and analyzes this data using artificial intelligence tools, including language models
and vector search, to answer due diligence questions without requiring human intervention.
This automation enables faster and more efficient analysis by reducing the time and manual
effort required to assess individual crypto funds, while ensuring consistent and reliable results.
• Generate Comprehensive Reports: The final objective is to generate detailed, clear, and
professional reports that summarize the findings of the due diligence process. These reports
are automatically created in PowerPoint format and include the fund’s profile, risk scores,
regulatory observations, and other key insights. The report templates are designed to be
visually appealing and easy to understand, allowing investors and decision-makers to review
due diligence results quickly and make informed choices. This step also supports communi-
cation with external stakeholders, such as clients or regulatory bodies.
These four objectives-developing an application, detecting risk, automating the process, and
generating reports are central to the value DueXpert brings to the due diligence process.
3.3. Stakeholders
DueXpert is designed to benefit several groups involved in the evaluation, regulation, and man-
agement of cryptocurrency investments. Each stakeholder has specific needs that the platform
addresses through its features.
• Retail and Institutional Investors: Investors need to verify if a crypto fund is secure,
profitable, and compliant. DueXpert helps by providing clear, structured reports and real-
time answers to due diligence questions. These features reduce the effort and complexity
of reviewing investment opportunities and help both small and large investors make better
decisions, with less time and cost.
• Crypto Fund Managers: For fund managers, DueXpert offers a way to demonstrate trans-
parency and credibility. By using the system to evaluate their own funds, managers can check
compliance status, identify areas of improvement, and generate professional reports to share
with investors. This enhances their ability to attract and retain investment by showing they
meet key due diligence standards.
• Regulators and Compliance Bodies: Regulatory institutions benefit from DueXpert’s ability
to automate the review of fund documentation and detect signs of non-compliance. The
platform can assist in monitoring whether crypto funds meet legal and financial reporting
obligations, including those related to anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer
(KYC), and tax reporting. This helps regulators oversee the ecosystem more effectively and
take timely action when needed.
• Traditional Financial Institutions: Banks and other financial organizations entering the
crypto space need reliable tools to assess potential risks. DueXpert provides a comprehensive
analysis of crypto funds in a format that is structured and easy to integrate into internal
review processes. It supports these institutions in making cautious, data-driven decisions
about partnerships or investments.
DueXpert’s features—including its structured framework, automated processing, risk detection,
and report generation—are built around the needs of these core stakeholders. By simplifying and
accelerating due diligence, it enables each of them to operate more securely and efficiently in the
rapidly evolving world of digital assets.
4. Data Acquisition and Understanding
One of the foundational steps in the DueXpert project was the acquisition and exploration of
data related to cryptocurrency funds. Given the decentralized nature of the crypto ecosystem and
the diversity of data sources, this step required the collection of both structured and unstruc-

Page 4

IEEE Transactions on AI for Financial Technologies
Automated Due Diligence of Crypto Funds Using AI and TDSP
tured information from multiple channels. The goal was to ensure that all relevant aspects of a
fund—financial, legal, technical, and operational—were included in the due diligence process.
4.1. Data Sources
The data acquisition strategy for DueXpert involved collecting information from various domains,
including public APIs, official documentation, regulatory databases, and blockchain networks. The
sources were chosen to align with the requirements of the due diligence application and to provide
enough coverage for the identification of key risk factors.
• APIs: The platform integrated with trusted APIs such as CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko,
Glassnode, CryptoCompare, and Etherscan to collect market data, on-chain analytics, and
blockchain-related statistics. These sources provided insights into token prices, trading vol-
umes, wallet movements, contract interactions, and other essential metrics.
• Blockchain Nodes: Ethereum and Bitcoin node connections were used to directly access
and verify blockchain transaction data, offering an additional layer of trust and transparency
for risk analysis.
• Regulatory and Legal Sources: Data from government repositories such as the SEC’s
EDGAR database was used to gather legal disclosures and regulatory filings. These docu-
ments helped determine whether a fund complied with existing financial laws and provided
transparency on ownership and fund structure.
• Web Scraping: For information not available through structured APIs, tools like BeautifulSoup
and Selenium were used to scrape content from crypto fund websites, legal portals, and news
articles. This included whitepapers, investment brochures, compliance statements, and legal
disclaimers.
This multi-layered data collection approach enabled DueXpert to cover the various dimensions of
a crypto fund needed for effective due diligence.
4.2. Data Types and Content
The acquired data was both qualitative and quantitative in nature. Key categories included:
• Descriptive Data: Information about the fund’s name, team, strategy, and jurisdiction.
• Financial Data: Historical token prices, fund returns, assets under management (AUM),
liquidity metrics.
• Regulatory Data: Registration details, AML/KYC status, license verification, and any previous
compliance violations.
• Technical Data: Smart contract details, GitHub activity, and contract audit reports.
• Transactional Data: Blockchain interactions, wallet balances, and transfer histories.
These datasets provided a comprehensive view of a fund’s operations and risk exposure.
4.3. Data Understanding and Exploration
Before applying any AI models or automation techniques, the team conducted an exploratory data
analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, distribution, and quality of the collected data. This step
included:
•
Verifying the completeness and consistency of the collected data.
•
Identifying missing values and noisy entries in scraped text and PDFs.
•
Analyzing token behavior over time to flag suspicious activities or abrupt changes in market
patterns.
This preliminary phase was crucial in shaping the data engineering and modeling steps that
followed. It ensured that only reliable and relevant information was passed to the due diligence
pipeline, supporting the accuracy and credibility of the final outputs.

5. Data Preparation
After conducting exploratory data analysis, the project entered the data preparation phase, where
both structured and unstructured data were cleaned, transformed, and organized for use in the
DueXpert system. This step was critical to ensure the quality, consistency, and usability of the
data before it was fed into the AI models, risk analysis components, and report generation tools.
5.1. Preparation of Unstructured Data
DueXpert relies heavily on unstructured documents such as fund whitepapers, legal filings, au-
dit reports, and web-based content. These documents were collected via web scraping, PDF
extraction tools (e.g., PDFMiner, PyMuPDF), and regulatory sources.
Once collected, the documents underwent text cleaning and normalization. This included re-
moving unwanted characters, correcting encoding issues, and ensuring sentence segmentation.
The cleaned text was then processed using natural language processing (NLP) tools to extract
important entities such as project names, dates, jurisdictions, wallet addresses, compliance terms,
and team members. These entities were stored in structured formats for downstream analysis and
used for semantic search and compliance verification.
Large text documents were also chunked semantically into smaller, meaningful sections to
support the GenAI-powered question-answering module. These chunks were vectorized using
sentence embedding models like nomic-embed-text, and indexed using tools like FAISS to allow
fast and relevant document retrieval.
5.2. Preparation of structured Data
In addition to unstructured text, the project also used structured time-series data, particularly
token price histories and transaction volume data. This data was collected from APIs such as
CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and Etherscan, and included metrics like:
•
Token price over time
•
Market volume
•
Wallet activity
•
On-chain transaction counts
After collection, this structured data was cleaned by handling missing values, ensuring consistent
date formats, and verifying numeric ranges. It was then formatted into time series datasets. This
structured data was prepared specifically for modeling with an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
neural network, which was used later in the pipeline to forecast token behavior and enrich the
fund’s risk profile.
5.3. Data Storage and Organization
Once cleaned and processed, the data was stored in appropriate systems:
• MongoDB stored semi-structured content and document metadata.
• FAISS was used for indexing document embeddings to support fast retrieval in the Q&A
system.
This clear separation of data types ensured smooth integration between the data preparation
pipeline and the later AI models and applications.
6. System Architecture Overview
To provide a high-level understanding of the platform’s components and data flow, we present
the overall architecture of DueXpert in Fig. 1. The system is organized into multiple layers, each
responsible for a distinct part of the pipeline: data collection, storage, processing, modeling, de-
ployment, and user interaction. These layers interact seamlessly to enable end-to-end automation
of the crypto fund due diligence process. This modular design supports scalability, maintainability,
and efficient integration of AI components such as LLM-based risk scoring and LSTM forecasting.

Fig. 1: System Architecture Overview of the DueXpert Platform.
The architecture illustrates the pipeline from data acquisition and processing to modeling,
deployment, and interface delivery.
In the following sections, we detail the key AI modules illustrated in the architecture, including
NLP-driven document analysis, the GraphRAG question-answering engine, and the LSTM-based
financial forecasting model.
7. Modeling and Algorithm Development
The modeling phase of the DueXpert project focused on building intelligent, scalable components
that could automate due diligence tasks such as document analysis, risk detection, dynamic
question answering, and report generation. The modeling approach was carefully designed to work
with the types of data collected during the earlier stages—both unstructured (e.g., whitepapers,
audits) and structured (e.g., token prices, transaction metrics). Instead of training or fine-tuning
models from scratch, the project relied on pretrained large language models and GraphRAG
(Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to extract and interpret knowledge, while a time-
series LSTM model was used for risk-aware forecasting.
8. Modeling and Algorithm Development
The modeling phase of the DueXpert project integrates natural language processing components
to automate the due diligence process. This phase begins with document ingestion and ends with
the generation of reliable, context-aware answers to risk-based questions using a Large Language
Model (LLM).
8.1. Document Ingestion and Parsing
Users upload unstructured documents such as crypto fund whitepapers, compliance reports, or
scanned disclosures. These documents are parsed using a combination of OCR-based tools (such
as PyMuPDF and PDFMiner) and natural language processing (NLP) pipelines. The goal is to
extract clean, structured text from a variety of formats, including PDFs, images, and scanned
documents.

Automated Due Diligence of Crypto Funds Using AI and TDSP
8.2. Chunking and Embedding
Once the text is extracted and cleaned, it is semantically segmented into coherent units (or
”chunks”). These chunks are then converted into vector representations using a pretrained nomic-
embed-text embedding model. The resulting embeddings are stored in a FAISS-based vector
database for fast and accurate similarity retrieval. In parallel, the extracted and processed chunks
are saved in MongoDB.
8.3. Graph-Based Retrieval with GraphRAG
To enhance context awareness and reduce hallucinations in LLM responses, the platform uses a
Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) system. In this approach, each text
chunk becomes a node in a semantic graph. Edges between nodes represent topic similarity,
shared entities, or logical continuity. When a due diligence question is posed, the query is em-
bedded and matched to a relevant subgraph, rather than retrieving isolated chunks. This ensures
that the response is based on semantically connected evidence.
8.4. Question Answering with LLaMA 3.1
Once the relevant subgraph is retrieved, it is passed as context to a Large Language Model—specifically,
LLaMA 3.1. The model uses this grounded knowledge to answer predefined due diligence ques-
tions from the system’s question bank. These questions cover legal, financial, technical, and
governance-related risks. The answers generated by the LLM are then forwarded to the evaluation
pipeline for risk scoring.
8.5. Risk Scoring and Rule-Based Evaluation
The risk scoring module in DueXpert is designed to deliver a transparent, explainable, and fully
automated risk evaluation of a crypto fund. The system does not rely on probabilistic machine
learning models for classification. Instead, it uses a structured pipeline powered by a language
model acting under strict instructions—combined with a mathematical aggregation framework to
generate the final score.
Each due diligence question is first posed to the GraphRAG-based retrieval system, which
returns a context grounded in the fund’s documentation. The context is then passed to a pretrained
Large Language Model (Llama3.1). To ensure reliability and consistency, the model is given a
specific role prompt:
”You are a Senior Investment Risk Analyst. Your task is to review the answer and classify the
risk based on its content. Return one and only one of the following labels: ’positive’, ’partial’, or
’missing’.”
This approach eliminates ambiguity and hallucination by forcing the model to return only one of
the four allowed labels per answer.
Each label is then mapped to a numerical risk score using the following logic:
• If the evaluation is ”positive”, the risk score is set to 0.0, indicating low risk.
• If the evaluation is ”partial”, the score is 0.5, representing a moderate risk.
• For evaluations labeled ”negative” or ”missing”, the score is assigned a value of 1.0, corre-
sponding to high or critical risk.
These individual scores are treated as Question Risk %.
8.5.0.a. Example – Risk Classification Mapping
LLM Evaluation: partial
Mapped Score: 0.5
Risk Category: Use of Funds →Financial Risk
Each due diligence category (e.g., Legal, Financial, Governance, Technical, etc.) contains a
defined number of critical questions. The Category Risk % is computed as the average of the
Vol. xx, No. xx, June 2009
Page 8

IEEE Transactions on AI for Financial Technologies
Automated Due Diligence of Crypto Funds Using AI and TDSP
individual question scores within that category:
Category Risk % =
P Question Risk %
Number of Critical Questions in Category
(1)
This provides a normalized score per category, where 0% is ideal and 100% is high risk.
The platform groups categories into two main dimensions:
• Core Risk %: Represents operational and compliance-related risk.
• Strategic Risk %: Reflects reputational, governance, and future-oriented concerns.
These are calculated using weighted averages:
Core Risk % =
X
(Category Risk % × Category Weight)
(2)
Strategic Risk % =
X
(Category Risk % × Normalized Category Weight)
(3)
Category weights are pre-assigned based on business relevance, and normalization ensures fair
aggregation.
The final Total Risk % for a fund is the sum of the core and strategic scores:
Total Risk % = Core Risk % + Strategic Risk %
(4)
This single percentage value reflects the fund’s overall risk and can be used to drive reporting,
decision-making, and flagging of high-risk projects.
8.6. LSTM-Based Market Behavior Forecasting
While traditional due diligence focuses on reviewing past and present information, it is equally
important to assess how a fund’s associated cryptocurrency may behave in the near future.
For this reason, DueXpert includes a forecasting module that adds a forward-looking financial
dimension to the risk evaluation. This component uses a deep learning model—called a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network—to analyze historical price data and predict how the price
of a fund’s token might evolve over the next month.
Why Forecasting Matters
In the crypto market, prices are highly volatile and can shift quickly due to external events, internal
project changes, or investor sentiment. Forecasting helps anticipate such movements. If the model
predicts a strong drop or a period of instability, this is flagged as a potential risk. Even if a
project looks reliable on paper, such signals may suggest underlying concerns that require deeper
investigation.
What the Model Does
The model is trained to look at the past 60 days of a token’s activity—including its price, volume,
and daily changes—and use this information to forecast the next 30 days. The goal is not to
predict exact prices but to detect unusual patterns, such as:
• A sudden expected decline
• Strong fluctuations (volatility)
• Signs of market instability
These patterns, once detected, are passed along to the report and risk scoring system.
How It Works
The LSTM model is a type of deep learning models for sequential data that is especially good
Vol. xx, No. xx, June 2009
Page 9

IEEE Transactions on AI for Financial Technologies
Automated Due Diligence of Crypto Funds Using AI and TDSP
at learning patterns over time, like recognizing trends in a graph. It was trained using historical
token data from trusted sources such as CoinGecko and blockchain explorers.
The model learns how token prices usually behave, and when it sees new data, it can estimate
where the price might go next. It doesn’t work by guessing, but by identifying statistical trends
and comparing them to previous behaviors.
To ensure that the model is accurate and useful, it was tested using common evaluation
techniques. The results showed that its forecasts were highly reliable, with small errors and a
strong ability to match actual price movements.
How Forecasting Fits into Due Diligence
The insights produced by the forecasting model do not replace document analysis—they add an
extra layer of financial awareness. For example, if a token’s documentation looks solid, but the
model forecasts instability, DueXpert highlights this in the final report. It’s a way of catching risks
that might not be visible in the whitepaper or legal materials.
By combining both static and dynamic analysis, DueXpert offers a more complete picture of the
fund’s risk profile—helping users not just evaluate the present, but also prepare for what might
come next.
Input: 60 days of token data (price, open, high, low, volume, percent change)
Model Output: Predicted prices for 30 future days show a consistent downward trend
with high volatility.
Interpretation: DueXpert flags this token as financially unstable over the short term,
despite strong documentation.

8.7. Automated Report Generation
One of the final steps in the DueXpert pipeline is the automatic generation of a professional due
diligence report, designed to summarize all the insights gathered during the analysis in a clear,
structured, and investor-friendly format. This feature is especially important because, while the
internal system performs advanced AI-driven processing, the final output must be understandable,
actionable, and ready to share with decision-makers who may not be technically trained.
Purpose of the Report
The primary goal of the report is to translate complex data outputs into a structured summary
that highlights the key findings about a crypto fund. It includes sections that cover the fund’s

background, regulatory compliance, team transparency, technical infrastructure, token behavior,
and risk forecasts. This report enables investors, analysts, or regulators to review a fund’s status
without needing to manually read through whitepapers, legal disclosures, or blockchain records.
Report Format and Structure
The report is generated in Microsoft PowerPoint (.pptx) format, using an automated process
powered by the python-pptx library. A branded and pre-designed template is used to ensure
consistency across different reports. Each report includes the following key sections:
• Executive Summary: A concise overview of the fund and its overall risk score
• Risk Score Breakdown: Visual representations of the scores in each category (e.g., legal,
technical, financial)
• Compliance Review: Key findings related to KYC, jurisdiction, and regulatory disclosures
• Forecast Analysis: Graphs showing predicted token price behavior
• Detected Red Flags: Warnings or missing elements automatically flagged by the system
• Recommendations: Optional suggestions or next steps based on the findings
The use of PowerPoint format makes the report easy to read, share, and present in meetings or
internal review boards.
The report is generated automatically once the analysis pipeline completes. There is no need for
human editing or formatting. Users can download the report with one click through the interface,
ensuring fast delivery of insights.
9. Evaluation
9.1. Evaluation of the Risk Classification (LLM-Based)
To ensure the reliability of the LLM-based classification system used for scoring due diligence
answers, the team carefully designed prompts that instructed the LLM to rely only on the provided
source materials. This was done to prevent hallucinations and ensure that the model did not
generate answers beyond the given content
prompts:” ”
9.2. Evaluation of the LSTM Forecasting Model
To assess the forecasting model’s ability to anticipate crypto token trends, the LSTM was tested
on unseen time-series data. It was evaluated using standard regression metrics:
TABLE I: Evaluation metrics for LSTM model
Metric
Value
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
2,117.38
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
2,886.87
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
3.73%
R2 Score
0.986
These results show that the model was able to predict price movements with high accuracy
and minimal error. The strong R² score indicates that the model was able to explain most of the
variation in the data, confirming its usefulness as an added layer of risk awareness.
