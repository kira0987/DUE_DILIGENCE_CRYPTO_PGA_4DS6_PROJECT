Crypto Fund Due Diligence Automation 
 
What is the Problem (Problematique)? 
 
The cryptocurrency space is growing fast, but investing in crypto funds and projects has several risks 
and challenges: 
 
1. Lack of Transparency: 
 
    It’s hard to determine if a crypto fund or project is legitimate. Scammers can easily publish 
documents that look credible but hide risks or fraudulent activities. 
 
2. Overwhelming Information: 
 
   Investors face large amounts of complex data, such as whitepapers, performance reports, 
and compliance documents. Analyzing these manually is time-consuming and difficult. 
 
3. Regulatory Risks: 
 
   Crypto funds must comply with financial regulations, such as anti-money laundering 
(AML) laws. However, verifying this is challenging without expertise. 
 
4. Complexity of Due Diligence: 
 
   Conducting due diligence involves assessing legal compliance, market risks, team 
credibility, and fund performance. This process is complicated and not beginner-friendly. 

 
5. Lack of Automated Tools: 
 
   Investors currently don’t have tools to easily analyze documents, ask questions, or generate 
reports to make informed decisions. 
What Does the Project Aim to Solve? 
         Our project streamlines and automates the due diligence process for cryptocurrency funds by: 
 
Automating Data Collection: 
 Collecting data from APIs, websites, and documents to deliver comprehensive insights into 
crypto funds. 
 
Building a Q&A System:  
Enabling users to upload documents (e.g., whitepapers) or ask specific questions about crypto 
funds to receive accurate, AI-powered answers. 
 
 
Generating PowerPoint Reports: 
Automatically generating detailed, professional reports that summarize key findings, 
including fund overviews, risk assessments, and compliance statuses. 
 
Simplified Explanation of the Problem 
Our project helps investors assess cryptocurrency funds by automating data collection, 
analyzing risks and compliance using AI, and providing clear answers to user questions. It simplifies 
evaluating fund safety, identifying red flags, and sharing findings through professional reports. 
 
what is cryptocurrency fund ? 
 
A cryptocurrency fund is an investment fund that focuses on cryptocurrencies and blockchain-
based projects. It pools money from multiple investors and uses that capital to invest in 

cryptocurrencies, tokens, or blockchain startups. These funds are managed by professionals who aim 
to generate returns for investors 
 
  How Does a Cryptocurrency Fund Work? 
  Pooling Capital: 
 
Individuals or institutions contribute money to the fund. 
 
The fund manager uses this pooled money to invest in various crypto-related assets. 
  Investment Focus: 
 
Funds may invest in cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum). 
 
They may also invest in blockchain startups, decentralized finance (DeFi), or NFTs (non-
fungible tokens). 
 
  Returns: 
 
Investors earn profits (or losses) based on the performance of the fund’s investments. 
 
Returns may come from price appreciation of cryptocurrencies, staking rewards, or other 
crypto activities. 
 
 Examples of Cryptocurrency Funds 
1. Polychain Capital: 
o 
Focuses on investing in blockchain protocols and startups. 
2. Pantera Capital: 
o 
One of the largest crypto hedge funds, investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain 
projects. 
3. Grayscale Investments:

Why is Due Diligence Important for Crypto Funds? 

Since cryptocurrency funds deal with volatile and complex assets, due diligence is crucial to 
ensure: 
4. The fund is legitimate and not a scam. 
5. The fund complies with laws and regulations. 
6. Investors understand the risks and strategies. 
 
What is the Core Problem? 
How can we simplify, automate, and improve the due diligence process for cryptocurrency
