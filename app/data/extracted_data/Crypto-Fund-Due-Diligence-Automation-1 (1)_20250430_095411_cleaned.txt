Crypto Fund Due Diligence Automation
What is the Problem (Problematique)?
The cryptocurrency space is growing fast, but investing in crypto funds and projects has several risks
1. Lack of Transparency:
It’s hard to determine if a crypto fund or project is legitimate. Scammers can easily publish
documents that look credible but hide risks or fraudulent activities.
2. Overwhelming Information:
Investors face large amounts of complex data, such as whitepapers, performance reports,
and compliance documents. Analyzing these manually is time consuming and difficult.
3. Regulatory Risks:
Crypto funds must comply with financial regulations, such as anti money laundering
(AML) laws. However, verifying this is challenging without expertise.
4. Complexity of Due Diligence:
Conducting due diligence involves assessing legal compliance, market risks, team
credibility, and fund performance. This process is complicated and not beginner friendly.

5. Lack of Automated Tools:
Investors currently don’t have tools to easily analyze documents, ask questions, or generate
reports to make informed decisions.
What Does the Project Aim to Solve?
Our project streamlines and automates the due diligence process for cryptocurrency funds by:
Automating Data Collection:
Collecting data from APIs, websites, and documents to deliver comprehensive insights into

including fund overviews, risk assessments, and compliance statuses.
Simplified Explanation of the Problem
Our project helps investors assess cryptocurrency funds by automating data collection,
analyzing risks and compliance using AI, and providing clear answers to user questions. It simplifies
evaluating fund safety, identifying red flags, and sharing findings through professional reports.
